<h4>02 Apr 2020</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We finished the slides from last class, focusing on the connection between locality and quantification in the context of transformations. In particular we saw how functional binary relations (such as successor but not precedence) can be included in a model signature as a function, which allows 'local' conditions to be expressed without quantification (in contrast to FO and MSO logic). </li>
  <li> Please begin thinking about possible <a href="materials/class15-research-directions.pdf">research directions</a>. </li>
</ul>


<h4>31 Mar 2020</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We continued to go over the slides from last class, focusing on the SL and SP classes of constraints. </li>
  <li> Short papers were returned with feedback. </li>
  <li> Extra time for the subregular constraint exercises is available if needed. </li>
</ul>


<h4>SPRING BREAK</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Spring Break has been extended through March 27.
</ul>


<h4>12 Mar 2020</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Today is our first attempt at synchronous, long-distance learning over the internet.
    <ul>
      <li>Our slack workspace is here: <a href="https://lin626spring2-7dd9216.slack.com">lin626spring2-7dd9216.slack.com</a></li>
      <li>Note <b>the videoconference has been recorded</b> following
      best practices of synchronous, online education.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Here are today's <a href="materials/class13-subreg.pdf">slides</a> on families of constraints defined with propositional logic.
  <li> Here are <a href="materials/hws/2-subreg.pdf">subregular constraint exercises</a> that are due on March 31 (which we will go over partially in class today.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>10 Mar 2020</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We began exploring constraints definable with propositional
    logic, where the atomic propositions correspond
    to <a href="materials/class12-connected-strucs.pdf">connected relational structures</a>.
</ul>

<h4>05 Mar 2020</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We finished our discussion of weighted logic.
</ul>


<h4>03 Mar 2020</h4>
<ul>
  <li> I answered some questions about FO/MSO constraints and transformations. </li>
  <li> We went over <a href="materials/class11-weighted-logic.pdf">weighted logic</a> and two examples.</li>
  <li> We will go over a couple more examples next class.</li>
</ul>

<h4>27 Feb 2020</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We continued discussing how to define string-to-string
  functions logically. </li>
  <li> Please pick a phonology problem to analyze for your short paper
    by by Thursday March 5. Here are some example short papers as
    examples of what is expected for your short paper due March 12 (feedback welcome):
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="materials/dcp/dcp11-HSG.pdf">Tibetan numerals</a></li>
