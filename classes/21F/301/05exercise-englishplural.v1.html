<li><p>With three allomorphs there are at least three underlying representations (UR) to consider: /-s/ or /-z/ or /-əz/.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis: The UR is /-s/. Under this hypothesis, we need to change [s] to [z] after [g, b, i, ʊ]. This group of sounds could be characterized as &quot;voiced consonants and vowels&quot;. So we could say the phonological rule is &quot;[s] becomes [z] after voiced consonants and vowels&quot;. Note this doesn't work for [d͡ʒ] which is a voiced consonant. Sounds like [ʃ, d͡ʒ] are known as <em>sibilant</em> sounds. This means they have a lot of noise high in their acoustic spectrum. So we could revise the phonological rule to be &quot;[s] becomes [z] after non-sibilant voiced consonants and vowels&quot;.</p>
<p>Then we also need to change [s] to [-əz] after [ʃ, d͡ʒ]. We could say something like &quot;[s] becomes [-əz] after sibilants&quot;. This is unsatisfactory though, because we would like to specify the changes: the insertion of the schwa and the voicing of the [s] to [z]. The insertion of schwa could be motivated to separate the [s] from the next sibilant. But what motivates the voicing?</p>
<p>This is a rough sketch of the analysis under the hypothesis that the UR is /-s/.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis: The UR is /-z/. Under this hypothesis, we need to change [z] to [s] after [t, k]. This group of sounds could be characterized as &quot;unvoiced consonants&quot;. So we could say the phonological rule is &quot;[z] becomes [s] after unvoiced consonants&quot;. Note this doesn't work for [ʃ] which is an unvoiced consonant. So we could revise the phonological rule to be &quot;[z] becomes [s] after non-sibilant unvoiced consonants&quot;.</p>
<p>Then we also need to change [z] to [-əz] after [ʃ, d͡ʒ]. We could say something like &quot;Schwa is inserted between [z] and a sibilant&quot;.</p>
<p>Note both of these processes appear to have a motivation. We separate adjacent sibilants with a schwa. And we devoice the [z] when it is adjacent to an unvoiced consonant.</p>
<p>This is a rough sketch of the analysis under the hypothesis that the UR is /-z/.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis: The UR is /-əz/. Under this hypothesis, we need to change [əz] to [s] after [t, k]. This group of sounds could be characterized as &quot;non-sibilant unvoiced consonants&quot;. So we could say the phonological rule is &quot;[əz] becomes [s] after non-sibilant unvoiced consonants&quot;. This is unsatisfactory though, because we would like to specify the changes: the deletion of the schwa and the devoicing of the [z] to [s]. The devoicing could be motivated by the absence in voicing in the environment, but what motivates the deletion of schwa?</p>
<p>Then we also need to change [z] to [-əz] after [ʃ, d͡ʒ]. We could say something like &quot;Schwa is inserted between [z] and a sibilant&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a rough sketch of the analysis under the hypothesis that the UR is /-əz/.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we can evaluate the hypotheses. While each can account for the data under consideration, the hypothesis that The UR is /-z/ posits phonological changes that are better motivated. On these grounds, we can say this is the best hypothesis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General Lesson: Phonological environments are often succinctly characterized by phonetic properties. Phonological changes are often motivated by phonetic considerations as well. If there are competing phonological hypotheses that account for the data, their phonetic 'naturalness' may distinguish them.</strong></p></li>
