<h1 id="the-introduction">The Introduction</h1>
<p>Introductions can be short, just 1-2 sentences.</p>
<ul>
<li>“This essay provides a phonological analysis of the 2nd person possessive morphology of Xavante, a language native to Brazil.”</li>
<li>“Xavante is a language spoken in Brazil. Here I examine alternations in its possessive morphology.”</li>
<li>“Xavante, a language of Brazil, shows some interesting allomorphy in its possessive morphology. In what follows I provide a phonological analysis of this allomorphy.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="an-explanation-of-how-words-are-formed-morphology">An explanation of how words are formed (morphology)</h1>
<ul>
<li>“The 2nd person possessive is formed in Xavante by adding a prefix to the noun stem.”</li>
<li>“To form the second person possessive, the prefix [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, J, - (End IPA)] is added to nouns.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-description-of-the-allomorphy-observed">A description of the allomorphy observed</h1>
<ul>
<li>“This prefix takes various additional forms, however, including [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, D, -, ,, , glottal stop, A, T, -, ,, , glottal stop, A, esh, - (End IPA)].”</li>
<li>“There are four allomorphs of the 2nd person possessive prefix: [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, J, -, ,, , glottal stop, A, D, -, ,, , glottal stop, A, T, -, ,, , glottal stop, A, esh, - (End IPA)].”</li>
<li>“For example, ‘your hair’ is [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, esh, esh, epsilon, long mark, R, epsilon (End IPA)] and ‘your eye’ is [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, T, T, open o (End IPA)].”</li>
<li>“Another allomorph is [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, T, - (End IPA)] as in [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, T, T, open o (End IPA)] ‘your eye’.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-description-of-the-sound-changes-observed-and-their-environments.">A description of the sound changes observed and their environments.</h1>
<ul>
<li>“In other words, we see alternations ocurring between [(Begin IPA) J, ,, , D, ,, , T, ,, , , , , , esh (End IPA)].'' .”</li>
<li>“The [(Begin IPA) J (End IPA)] occurs before nouns beginning with [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, ,, , H, ,, , B, ,, , , , , , P (End IPA)]. The [(Begin IPA) D (End IPA)] only occurs before nouns beginning with [(Begin IPA) D (End IPA)]...”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="justification-of-urs-and-rules">Justification of URs and rules</h1>
<p>Remember, justifications are usually comparative: of the possibiilities, why does the one you posit make the most sense?</p>
<ul>
<li>“The allomorph [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, J, - (End IPA)] occurs in the broadest variety of phonological envrionments and so I will posit this as the underlying representation of the prefix. This will require phonological rules that change /j/ to [(Begin IPA) D (End IPA)] before [(Begin IPA) D (End IPA)], to [(Begin IPA) T (End IPA)] before [(Begin IPA) T (End IPA)] and to [(Begin IPA) esh (End IPA)] before [(Begin IPA) esh (End IPA)]. Each of these rules is a natural assimilation rule.''</li>
<li>“On the other hand, if we posited the underlying form to be /ʔad-/ then we would need to change /d/ to [(Begin IPA) J (End IPA)] before [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, ,, , H, ,, , B, ,, , P (End IPA)] ...”</li>
</ul>
<p>However, do <em>not</em> provide a personal history of how you developed your analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>“First I thought the underlying form could be /(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, T, - (End IPA)/ with a rule that changed /(Begin IPA) T (End IPA)/ to [(Begin IPA) J (End IPA)] before glottal sounds like [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, ,, , H (End IPA)]. But that didn't work for [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, J, P, A, long mark, R, A, long mark (End IPA)] 'foot'. Then I tried the underlying form /ʔad-/ with a similar rule, but that didn't work either. Finally, I realized that ...”</li>
</ul>
<p>A table showing the posited underlying forms of your proposed analysis can be helpful.</p>
<h1 id="defining-phonological-processes.">Defining phonological Processes.</h1>
<p>To the extent possible, use one English sentence explaining the sound change. It should say what changes, how it changes, and where it changes. It should refer to phonetic properties of sounds, and not morphological concepts. It is a good idea to give the process a name.</p>
<h1 id="illustrating-the-analysis">Illustrating the analysis</h1>
<p>Pick key examples that illustrate how your analysis works. Explain how the underlying forms of the morphemes get put together and how the phonological rule takes place.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Consider the word [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, D, D, U (End IPA)] 'stomach'. In this analysis, the morphology would put together underlying representation of the 2nd person possessive prefix /(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, J, - (End IPA)/ with underlying representation for 'stomach', which is /(Begin IPA) D, U (End IPA)/ yielding /(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, J, D, U (End IPA)/. The /(Begin IPA) J, D (End IPA)/ sequence meets the conditions for the rule of Aleveolar Consonant Assimilation and so this rule changes /(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, J, D, U (End IPA)/ to [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, D, D, U (End IPA)]. In the case of [(Begin IPA) glottal stop, A, J, P, A, long mark, R, A, long mark (End IPA)] 'foot', the underlying form of 'foot' begins with /(Begin IPA) P (End IPA)/ and so the rule of Alveolar Consonant Assimilation would not apply.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The conclusion can also be short, it can reiterate the main points of the analysis. It can also indicate predictions the analysis makes.</p>
<ul>
<li>“In this analysis, the allomorphy of the 2nd person possessive prefix was explained by positing the underlying form /ʔaj-/ and rules of consonant assimilation for alveolars. This predicts that other prefixes which also end in /j/ would have similar patterns of allomorphy.”</li>
</ul>
