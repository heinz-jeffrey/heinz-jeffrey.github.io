<h1 id="deletion-or-insertion">Deletion or Insertion?</h1>
<p>When a segment appears and disappears we call it <strong>alternating with zero</strong>. There are generally two types of analyses.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is it present in the underlying representation and being deleted? (The deletion analysis)</li>
<li>Is it absent in the underlying representation and being inserted? (The insertion analysis).</li>
</ol>
<p>When a speech sound is inserted, it is also called <strong>epenthesis</strong>.</p>
<p>A further complication is that if the alternation occurs at the juncture of two morphemes, and the segment is underlyingly present, which morpheme does it belong to? The way to resolve this is like before. Consider both hypotheses; systematically work out the consequences; and determine which hypothesis makes better sense.</p>
