<h1 id="the-introduction">The Introduction</h1>
<p>Introductions can be short, just 1-2 sentences.</p>
<ul>
<li>“This essay provides a phonological analysis of the 2nd person possessive morphology of Xavante, a language native to Brazil.”</li>
<li>“Xavante is a language spoken in Brazil. Here I examine alternations in its possessive morphology.”</li>
<li>“Xavante, a language of Brazil, shows some interesting allomorphy in its possessive morphology. In what follows I provide a phonological analysis of this allomorphy.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="an-explanation-of-how-words-are-formed-morphology">An explanation of how words are formed (morphology)</h1>
<ul>
<li>“The 2nd person possessive is formed in Xavante by adding a prefix to the noun stem.”</li>
<li>“To form the second person possessive, the prefix [ʔaj-] is added to nouns.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-description-of-the-allomorphy-observed">A description of the allomorphy observed</h1>
<ul>
<li>“This prefix takes various additional forms, however, including [ʔad-, ʔat-, ʔaʃ-].”</li>
<li>“There are four allomorphs of the 2nd person possessive prefix: [ʔaj-, ʔad-, ʔat-, ʔaʃ-].”</li>
<li>“For example, ‘your hair’ is [ʔaʃʃɛːrɛ] and ‘your eye’ is [ʔattɔ].”</li>
<li>“Another allomorph is [ʔat-] as in [ʔattɔ] ‘your eye’.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-description-of-the-sound-changes-observed-and-their-environments.">A description of the sound changes observed and their environments.</h1>
<ul>
<li>“In other words, we see alternations ocurring between [j, d, t, ʃ].'' .”</li>
<li>“The [j] occurs before nouns beginning with [ʔ, h, b, p]. The [d] only occurs before nouns beginning with [d]...”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="justification-of-urs-and-rules">Justification of URs and rules</h1>
<p>Remember, justifications are usually comparative: of the possibiilities, why does the one you posit make the most sense?</p>
<ul>
<li>“The allomorph [ʔaj-] occurs in the broadest variety of phonological envrionments and so I will posit this as the underlying representation of the prefix. This will require phonological rules that change /j/ to [d] before [d], to [t] before [t] and to [ʃ] before [ʃ]. Each of these rules is a natural assimilation rule.''</li>
<li>“On the other hand, if we posited the underlying form to be /ʔad-/ then we would need to change /d/ to [j] before [ʔ, h, b, p] ...”</li>
</ul>
<p>However, do <em>not</em> provide a personal history of how you developed your analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>“First I thought the underlying form could be /ʔat-/ with a rule that changed /t/ to [j] before glottal sounds like [ʔ, h]. But that didn't work for [ʔajpaːraː] 'foot'. Then I tried the underlying form /ʔad-/ with a similar rule, but that didn't work either. Finally, I realized that ...”</li>
</ul>
<p>A table showing the posited underlying forms of your proposed analysis can be helpful.</p>
<h1 id="defining-phonological-processes.">Defining phonological Processes.</h1>
<p>To the extent possible, use one English sentence explaining the sound change. It should say what changes, how it changes, and where it changes. It should refer to phonetic properties of sounds, and not morphological concepts. It is a good idea to give the process a name.</p>
<h1 id="illustrating-the-analysis">Illustrating the analysis</h1>
<p>Pick key examples that illustrate how your analysis works. Explain how the underlying forms of the morphemes get put together and how the phonological rule takes place.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Consider the word [ʔaddu] 'stomach'. In this analysis, the morphology would put together underlying representation of the 2nd person possessive prefix /ʔaj-/ with underlying representation for 'stomach', which is /du/ yielding /ʔajdu/. The /jd/ sequence meets the conditions for the rule of Aleveolar Consonant Assimilation and so this rule changes /ʔajdu/ to [ʔaddu]. In the case of [ʔajpaːraː] 'foot', the underlying form of 'foot' begins with /p/ and so the rule of Alveolar Consonant Assimilation would not apply.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The conclusion can also be short, it can reiterate the main points of the analysis. It can also indicate predictions the analysis makes.</p>
<ul>
<li>“In this analysis, the allomorphy of the 2nd person possessive prefix was explained by positing the underlying form /ʔaj-/ and rules of consonant assimilation for alveolars. This predicts that other prefixes which also end in /j/ would have similar patterns of allomorphy.”</li>
</ul>
