<li>When a morpheme exhibits allomorphy, its different forms are called <strong>allomorphs</strong>. The form of the morpheme can also be said to <strong>alternate</strong>. Sometimes allomorphs are also called <strong>alternants</strong>.</li>
<li>Under a phonological analysis, we aim to identify the form of the long-term memory representation of pronunciation of the morpheme. This form is often called <strong>the underlying form</strong>, or the <strong>the underlying representation</strong>.</li>
<li>A Phonological analysis of allomorphy predicts that <strong>the allomorphic variation is systematic</strong>. It predicts that morphemes whose underlying forms are the same in a particular phonological aspect, will <strong>pattern the same way</strong>.</li>
<li>Generally morphological selection analyses does not make this prediction since they effectively memorize which alternant is used in which contexts.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify the morphology (the morphemes and how they combine).</li>
<li>Identify the allomorphs/alternants (variation in the pronunciations of roots and affixes).</li>
<li>List the <strong>phonological</strong> contexts/environments for each alternant.</li>
<li>Make hypotheses about the underlying forms and phonological rules and check them on <em>every</em> data point to see if they work.
<ul>
<li>Generally (but not always), the allomorph which occurs in a <em>variety of contexts</em> or <em>elsewhere</em> is a good candidate for the underlying form.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repeat the previous step, making changes as needed.</li>

<h1 id="steps-3-and-4-can-be-hard">Steps 3 and 4 can be hard!</h1>
<p>We will study methods to help us with steps 3 and 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>For step 3, list the phonological environments where each alternant occurs and try to group them according to phonetic properties of the sounds.</li>
<li>For step 4, for each proposed underlying form, consider what phonological change will transform it to each alternant in the appropriate context.</li>
<li>For step 4, <em>rules</em> and <em>deriviations</em> help us better understand the consequences of each hypothesis and help us see if they “work” for our data.</li>
<li>For step 4, we will also compare phonological analyses in case more than one works!</li>
</ul>
