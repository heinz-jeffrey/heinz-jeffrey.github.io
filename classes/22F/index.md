# Course Log

## 13 Oct 2022

* Eric [presented](materials/Sclafani-LLP2.pdf) and led discussion on
  Heinz 2010.
* Jeff finished going over the last several slides from his [what does
  learning mean](materials/whatdoeslearningmean.pdf) talk, which
  emphasized how deterministic finite state machines define a
  parameterized concept class, and whether the concepts are formal
  (boolean) languages, stochastic languages, or string-to-string
  functions -- so whether the parameter values are boolean, reals, or
  strings -- the learning of these classes is conducted
  similarly. Papers exist which make these connections explicit for
  DFA more generally and k-SL and k-SP classes in particular.
* For next Tuesday, review the first 10 pages (up to 4.7) of the notes
  on identification in the limit. (We have already discussed up to 4.5
  on Oct 06).
* Also for those who are enrolled and have not yet presented yet,
  please think about which papers you would be interested in
  presenting over the next few weeks as I would like to schedule. Feel
  free to get in touch if you need pointers.

## 11 Oct 2022

* Fall break


## 06 Oct 2022

* We began our study of [identification in the
  limit](materials/idlimit.pdf).
* Read [Heinz 2010](http://jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Heinz-2010-LLP.pdf)
  for next Thursday. Eric will present.

## 04 Oct 2022

* Class canceled.

## 29 Sep 2022

* We discussed the rest of Chapter 5 of Valiant 2013.
* Jeff presented his talk [what does learning
  mean](materials/whatdoeslearningmean.pdf)

## 27 Sep 2022

* Sarah
  [presents](materials/Morphology-Language-Acquisition-Slides-Payne.pdf)
  on Lignos and Yang 2016.
* Read the rest of Valiant 2013 chapter 5 and write answers to [these
  questions](materials/04-pac-chap05-2.html) and send them to me
  [jeffrey.heinz@stonybrook.edu](mailto:jeffrey.heinz@stonybrook.edu).

## 22 Sep 2022

* Class cancelled. Try to check out the learning talks on Friday at [this workshop](https://www.jeffreyheinz.net/events/WMTRPprogram.html)

## 20 Sep 2022

* Magda [presented](materials/NoisyExamplesMarkowska.pdf) on Angluin
  and Laird's 1988 paper "Learning from Noisy Examples."

## 15 Sep 2022

* John presents on the VC
  dimension. ([Slides](materials/VC-Dimension-Murzaku.pdf))

## 13 Sep 2022

* We went over this [handout](materials/pacproofs.pdf) that reviewed
  the proof that the tightest-fit rectangle algorithm pac-learns the
  class of axis-aligned rectangles and the proof that the elimination
  algoritm pac-learns the class of monomials.
* For Thursday, read sections 1, 2 and 3 of chapter 3 KV94 on the VC
  dimension.

## 08 Sep 2022

* We reviewed the preliminary definition of PAC learnability.
* We discussed and explained the PAC learnability of axis-aligned
  rectangles.
* We discussed the modified definition of PAC learnability which takes
  into account the size of the representation of the concepts.
* We established a plan for the next several classes
  - Tue Sep 13: Jeff on PAC learning monomials (1.3 in KV94)
  - Thu Sep 15: John on the VC dimension (3.1, 3.2, 3.3 in KV94 and theorems 3.3,3.4)
  - Tue Sep 20: Magda on [Learning from Noisy Examples](materials/AngluinLaird1988.pdf), up to 2.3
  - Thu Sep 22: Class canceled because of [this
    workshop](https://www.jeffreyheinz.net/events/WMTRPprogram.html)
    At least see the learning talks from 4:30pm on Fri Sep 23!
  - Tue Sep 27: Sarah on [Morphology and Language Acquisition](materials/LignosYang2016.pdf)
