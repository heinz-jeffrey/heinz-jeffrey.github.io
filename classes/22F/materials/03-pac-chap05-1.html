<li><p>Suppose there are 10 marble types in the million marble urn, and you make 100 draws. Then you can conclude that with probability at least A% that no marble that occurs with probability greater than 2% has been missed, in which case the missing marbles can account for at most B% of the urnâ€™s contents. What are A and B?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you want to be be 95% confident that you have drawn marbles representative of 90% of the urn. You know that there are 7 types of marbles in the urn. What is the largest probability <em>p</em> that no marble type occurs with probability greater than <em>p</em>? And what is the fewest number of draws <em>N</em> that need to be made?</p></li>
