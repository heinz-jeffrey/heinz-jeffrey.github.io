# Course Log

## 09 Sep 2025

* We reviewed the proofs of theorems 4 and 6 and discussed them.
* We proved the following statement: Any finite class of languages is
  identifiable in the limit (hypothesizing testers) from positive
  (arbitrary) data.
* Time permitting, we considered the learnability of languages spoken
  on the planet [Verorez](materials/04verorez.pdf).
* For Thursday, begin reading [chapter 3](materials/HdlHvZ2015.pdf) on
  state-merging.


## 04 Sep 2025

* We went through the notes on [id in the
  limit](materials/03idlimit.pdf). In particular:
* We reviewed identification in the limit of testers from arbitrary
  text (commonly known as identification in the limit from positive
  data).
* We examined some two classes of formal languages (Strictly
  k-Piecewise and Strictly k-Local) and algorithms which can learn
  these classes under this definition of learning. Both exemplify
  "string extension learning" which is a particular kind of learning
  strategy. It has other properties as well which we will return to later.
* At the end of class we considered another strategy based on
  enumeration, and presented an algorithm which learns the class BAR-X
  under this definition.
* For next Tuesday please study Theorems 4 and 6 and their
  proofs. (You can skip Theorems 5 and 7 for now.)

## 02 Sep 2025

* We discussed the twelve identification in the limit paradigms that
  Gold introduced, the main results, and Gold's discussion of the
  implications of these results vis a vis child acquisition.
* We took a brief aside on [recursive function
  theory](materials/recursive-function-theory.pdf) to get an idea of
  some of the finer points of arbitrary functions/sets/text versus
  recursive functions/sets/text versus primitive recursive
  functions/sets/text.
*  Here are some notes on [id in the
  limit](materials/03idlimit.pdf). Please read up to, but not
  including, section 2.4 for Thursday. Document the mistakes!

## 28 Aug 2025

* We discussed finished talking about likelihood.
* We continued talking about learning as a computational problem.
* We discussed the first few sections of Gold 1967.
* We are prepared to discuss [enumeration](materials/02enumeration.pdf),
  which plays an important role in computability.
* For next Tuesday, read section 4 of Gold 1967.

## 26 Aug 2025

* We went over the syllabus.
* We introduced the idea of studying learning as a computational problem.
* We studied the meanings of consistent estimators.
* [01intro.pdf](materials/01intro.pdf)
* For Thursday: please read sections 1-3 of [Gold
  1967](materials/Gold--1967--LanguageIdentificationInTheLimit.pdf).
