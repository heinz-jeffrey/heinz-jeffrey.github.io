# Course Log


## 17 Feb

* We discussed the Lezgian assigment. Here are some [general
  comments](materials/lezgian-comments.md).
* We discussed Chapter 3 of [McCarthy
  2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf).
  - how to organize a paper
  - how to write an OT analysis
  - good scholarship, criticism
  - how to write clearly
* We discussed the current Ilokano assignment
  [pdf](materials/Ilokano.pdf) [html](materials/ilokano.html) due
  Thursday, February 26 during class.
* Read [McCarthy 2010](materials/McCarthy2010-HS.pdf) on Harmonic
  Serialism for Thursday. What are McCarthy's main arguments for HS?

## 12 Feb

* We concluded discussion of Chapter 2 of [McCarthy
  2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf) and the relevant
  [excerpts](materials/Chapter2discussion.txt).
* In particular we dicussed:
  - constraints in ranking arguments
  - inputs in ranking arguments
  - richness of the base
  - contrast in OT
  - finding and fixing problems, what to check
  - recursive constraint demotion
  - logic of constraint ranking (time permitting)
* Your next squib assignment is on Ilokano
  [pdf](materials/Ilokano.pdf) [html](materials/ilokano.html) and it
  is due Thursday, February 26 during class. Please **print a physical
  copy** of your assignment and turn it into me then.
* For next Tuesday, please read Chapter 3 of [McCarthy
  2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf).

## 10 Feb

* We continued our discussion of [McCarthy
  2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf) up to section 2.7.
* In particular we discussed:
  - violation and comparative tableaux and Hasse diagrams
  - the Yawelmani example illustrating how to come up with ranking arguments
  - limits of ranking arguents
  - candidates in ranking arguments
  - harmonic bounding
* Finish reading Chapter 2 of [McCarthy
  2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf) (you may skip section 2.9) by
  next Thursday, and be prepared to discuss the relevant
  [excerpts](materials/Chapter2discussion.txt).

## 05 Feb

* We discussed Lezgian, due next Tuesday.
* We discussed excerpts from the first couple sections of McCarthy
  2008, chapter 2.
* (optional) [Rooij and Baggio 2021](materials/RooijBaggio2021.pdf) on theorizing
  in cognitive science.
* For next Tuesday, please read up to section 2.7 (up to page 83) of
  [McCarthy 2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf) and be prepared to
  discuss the relevant [excerpts](materials/Chapter2discussion.txt).
* Finish reading Chapter 2 of [McCarthy
  2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf) (you may skip section 2.9) by
  next Thursday.

## 03 Feb

* We discussed any questions related to the intro handout.
* We discussed questions from McCarthy 2008, chapter 1.
* We intended to further discussed Lezgian, but did not, so we will
  start off with this on Thursday.
* Read Chapter 2 of [McCarthy 2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf) up
  to and including section 2.2 (up to page 53). Be prepared to
  disscuss the [excerpts](materials/Chapter2discussion.txt) from these
  sections.

## 29 Jan

* We went over the **syllabus**
  [pdf](materials/LIN623_Syllabus_Spring2026.pdf)
  [html](materials/LIN623_Syllabus_Spring2026.html).
* We went over the **introduction**
  [pdf](materials/01-intro.pdf)
  [html](materials/01-intro.html)
  to this course.
* We began discussion of the **Lezgian assignment**
  [pdf](materials/lezgian.pdf) [html](materials/lezgian.html) due
  Tuesday, February 10 during class. Please **print a physical copy**
  of your assignment and turn it into me then.
* For Tuesday, please read Chapter 1 of [McCarthy
  2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf) and be prepared to discuss the
  following questions.
  1. Section 1.2 asks "Why Must Constraints Be Violable?" Is
     McCarthy's argument convincing? Why or why not?
  2. In section 1.3, McCarthy writes "OT itself does not say much
     about the nature of constraints, beyond distinguishing between
     markedness and faithfulness. OT is a theory of how constraints
     interact with one another; it isn’t a theory of what the
     constraints are, nor is it a theory of representations." Why do
     you think this is or isn't true, and what does it mean for a
     theory of phonology?
  3. Section 1.4 claims the operations in GEN are "extremely
     general". Can you think of any reasonable limits to the
     operations GEN employs?
  4. Section 1.6 ends with McCarthy arguing against positing highly
     specific markedness constraints and says "The best practice in OT
     is to state constraints in very general ways and then try to
     limit their activity through interaction with higher-ranking
     constraints." In the specific case he discussed in Timugon Murut,
     how could one decide between these two alternatives?
  5. Please bring any questions you have about chapte 1 to class.

## 27 Jan

* University canceled class due to Sunday's snowstorm.
