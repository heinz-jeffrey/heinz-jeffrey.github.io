* We went over the **syllabus**
  [pdf](materials/LIN623_Syllabus_Spring2026.pdf)
  [html](materials/LIN623_Syllabus_Spring2026.html).
* We went over the **introduction**
  [pdf](materials/01-intro.pdf)
  [html](materials/01-intro.html)
  to this course.
* We began discussion of the **Lezgian assignment**
  [pdf](materials/lezgian.pdf) [html](materials/lezgian.html) due
  Tuesday, February 10 during class. Please **print a physical copy**
  of your assignment and turn it into me then.
* For Tuesday, please read Chapter 1 of [McCarthy
  2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf) and be prepared to discuss the
  following questions.
  1. Section 1.2 asks "Why Must Constraints Be Violable?" Is
     McCarthy's argument convincing? Why or why not?
  2. In section 1.3, McCarthy writes "OT itself does not say much
     about the nature of constraints, beyond distinguishing between
     markedness and faithfulness. OT is a theory of how constraints
     interact with one another; it isn’t a theory of what the
     constraints are, nor is it a theory of representations." Why do
     you think this is or isn't true, and what does it mean for a
     theory of phonology?
  3. Section 1.4 claims the operations in GEN are "extremely
     general". Can you think of any reasonable limits to the
     operations GEN employs?
  4. Section 1.6 ends with McCarthy arguing against positing highly
     specific markedness constraints and says "The best practice in OT
     is to state constraints in very general ways and then try to
     limit their activity through interaction with higher-ranking
     constraints." In the specific case he discussed in Timugon Murut,
     how could one decide between these two alternatives?
  5. Please bring any questions you have about chapte 1 to class.
