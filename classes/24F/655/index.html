<h2 id="oct-2024">31 Oct 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>We discussed ISL functions, ISL transductions, and QF(succ,pred) functions.</li>
<li>Here is the draft chapter of <a href="materials/dcpChap22.pdf">“Logical Perspectives on Strictly Local Transformations”</a> by Chandlee and Lindell.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="oct-2024-1">29 Oct 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using this <a href="materials/learning2.pdf">handout</a>, we formally introduced two learning criteria: identification in the limit from positive data and PAC.</li>
<li>We discussed compared the two frameworks and thought about what choices in a learning criterion make it easier or harder.</li>
<li>Supporting reading material: <a href="http://jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Heinz-2016-CTLDP.pdf">“Computational Theories of Learning and Developmental Psycholinguistics” (Heinz 2016)</a></li>
<li>Please read <a href="http://jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Chandlee-Heinz-2018-SLPM.pdf">“Strict Locality and Phonological Maps” (Chandlee and Heinz 2018)</a> for Thursday.</li>
<li>Also, we had some discussion about computable and noncomputable real numbers. This <a href="https://mathvoices.ams.org/featurecolumn/2021/12/01/alan-turing-computable-numbers/">recent summary from the ACM</a> reviews some of the issues. This paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0411418">“How real are real numbers”</a> is a bit more in depth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="oct-2024-2">24 Oct 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We continued our discussion of learning problems, and developed one related to learning strictly k-local languages. Those techniques have been generalized and developed in the papers <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P10-1092">String Extension Learning</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397512007128">Learning with Lattice-Structured Hypothesis Spaces</a>.

<li><p><strong>Short Paper Assignment</strong> (for students enrolled in 3 credits): Please turn in no later than Tuesday October 22, 2024 (in class). Please print your assignment and hand it in to me.</p>
<p>For this assignment, choose a morpho-phonological data set and provide an analysis of it. Your analysis should formalize the analysis using the logical transductions we have studied in class. Chapters 7 through 14 in Part 2 of DCP/DPC are samples of the kind of short paper expected. It is not necessary to compare your formalization to some other framework. It is necessary to be clear about the representations you are positing in the underlying and surface forms.</p>
<p>You <strong>may not choose</strong> one of the datasets in chapters 7 through 14 (unless you are proposing a radically different analysis.) You <strong>may choose</strong> a dataset you have previously analyzed using a different set of formal tools (such as with rules or OT). For example, datasets from Phonology 1 or 2 can be used, or even a dataset from an undergraduate phonology class or introductory textbook. You may choose a dataset you have collected, but such original research is not the purpose of this assignment, and may be more appropriate for a final project.</p>

<ul>
<li>We discussed the Chapter up to 2.6. In particular, how the successor model of strings, with and without features, can be combined with FO logic to provides a way to define well-formedness constraints. The representational primitives can be thought of as claims regarding the psychologically real primitives. They are the aspects of the representation that can be “looked up” for free.</li>
