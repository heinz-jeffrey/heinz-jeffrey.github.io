<p>Smaller, more well-structured learning classes can make learning easier. The subregular program aims to find classes of patterns which are both sufficiently expressive to describe natural language patterns and which are sufficiently structured to enable learning from small data.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="materials/Oncina-et-al-1993-OSTIA.pdf">OSTIA</a> and <a href="http://jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Chandlee-EyraudEtAl-2014-LSLSF.pdf">ISLFLA</a> are start merging algorithms (builds a prefix tree of the sample and then collapses states). <a href="https://www.jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Chandlee-EyraudEtAl-2015-OSLF.pdf">OSLFLA</a> draws the transitions into the DFT from the start state outwards. <a href="https://www.jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Jardine-ChandleeEtAl-2014-VELSCSFPD.pdf">SOSFIA</a> recognizes that the state space and transitions are fixed and aims to fill in what is unknown, which is just the outputs on the transitions.</p></li>
<li><p>SOSFIA cannot be used to learn the OSL class since OSL is not fixed by a DFT, unlike ISL-k. Many OSL functions are also (tier-based) reverse definite functions which can be represented by a fixed DFT <a href="https://openpublishing.library.umass.edu/scil/article/id/2137/">Lambert and Heinz 2024</a>. Anton points out these cannot handle blocking. Perhaps the blocking patterns are generalized definite?</p></li>
<li><p>We also discussed <a href="materials/GildeaJurafsky1996.pdf">Gildea and Jurafsky’s 1996</a> application of OSTIA to English flapping.</p></li>
<li><p>On Tuesday we will study how SOSFIA works.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nov-2024-3">19 Nov 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today we discussed <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/5780/">Burness et al. 2019 “Long-distance phonological processes as tier-based strictly local functions”</a>.
<ul>
<li>We reviewed SL formal languages and defined TSL formal languages. We observed that neutral letters (non-tier letters) can be added or subtracted anywhere to any word without impacting its membership status in the language. In finite-state terms, that means neutral letters never change state. They are self-loops. Any class of stringsets can be “tierified” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10849-023-09398-x">Lambert 2023</a>).</li>
<li>We reviewed ISL and defined OSL functions. We saw why iterative nasal spreading is not ISL but is OSL.</li>
<li>We examined why sequential functions admit functions sensitive to parity.</li>
<li>We saw how Burness et al. tierify the ISL and OSL classes, and why they argued that Tier ISL cannot express long-distance sibilant harmony but Tier OSL can.</li>
<li>We quickly acknowledged their treatment of more complex cases of long-distance functions that they showed to be T-OSL, and also quickly acknowledged the limitations they observed.</li>
<li>On Thursday, more learning!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nov-2024-4">14 Nov 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today we decided to discuss order preservation in string maps. We learned:
<ul>
<li>with precedence (&lt;) and FO it is straightforward:
<ul>
<li>&lt;(c,d)(x,y) := x&lt;y (when c &lt;= d)</li>
<li>&lt;(c,d)(x,y) := x&lt;=y (when d &lt; c)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>with successor (S) and FO it is not possible because unbounded spans in an input may delete.
<ul>
<li>Consider one copy: S(x,y) := xSy OR (Ex z1)[ x S z1 S y AND NOT lic(z1) ] OR (Ex z1,z2)[ x S z1 S z2 S y AND NOT lic(z1) AND NOT lic(z2)] OR .. (Ex z1,z2, .. zn)[ x S z1 S z2 S .. zn S y AND NOT lic(z1) AND NOT lic(z1) AND .. NOT lic(zn)]. The number of variables is bounded by some n but the input string can be longer than this n. Recall Chandlee and Lindell relate this idea to finite-to-one maps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In summary, order-preserving maps with FO(S) entail finite-to-one maps. Those entail partial functions since total functions may delete spans of unbounded length. (Consider C+V mapping to CV given by the OT grammar *ComplexOnset&gt;&gt;Max.)</li>
<li>Are there spans of unbounded deletion in phonology? Truncation comes close, but some truncation is clearly Reverse Definite. Ola mentioned truncation in Yoruba in the middle of words. We should look at that.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For Tuesday, read <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/5780/">Burness et al. 2019 “Long-distance phonological processes as tier-based strictly local functions”</a>. We will discuss then.
<ul>
<li>Note there is an error in Figure 6 in Burness et al. the transition from &gt; state [s] to [ʃ] with the transition labeled ʃ:ʃ should instead be from &gt; state [s] to [s] with label ʃ:s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tier-based OSL functions are deterministic, but do not have a fixed structure. This paper shows that the long-distance processes belong to classes which have a fixed, deterministic structure: <a href="https://openpublishing.library.umass.edu/scil/article/id/2137/">Lambert and Heinz (2024) “Algebraic Reanalysis of Phonological Processes Described as Output-Oriented”</a> The classes are the (left and right) reverse definite.
<ul>
<li>The algebraic analysis in this paper is technical. The heart of it though comes from the notion of Myhill equivalence. Lambert (under review) describes it this way: “In phonology, we often use minimal pairs to determine whether two phones represent distinct phonemes. For instance, Finnish has contrastive length on both vowels and consonants as demonstrated by the words [tːuli] ‘fire’, [t̪uːli] ‘wind’ and [t̪ulːi] ‘customs’, differing only in length. The t̪_li environment distinguishes [u] from [uː], and the t̪u_i environment distinguishes [l] from [lː]. In algebra, we do the same thing, except that rather than looking for differences in meaning, we seek differences in acceptability. Given arbitrary strings 𝑥 and 𝑦, we seek an environment 𝑢_𝑣 where 𝑢𝑥𝑣 is accepted and 𝑢𝑦𝑣 is rejected, or vice versa. If such an environment can be found, then 𝑥 and 𝑦 are distinct (Rabin &amp; Scott, 1959). Otherwise, they are Myhill-equivalent with respect to the language.” This is for sets of strings; for string maps, it’s the same idea but takes into account output behavior as well.</li>
<li>We do not need to read this one for Tuesday, but I will mention it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On Thursday, we will discuss the importance of determinism for learning.</li>

<li><p><strong>Short Paper Assignment</strong> (for students enrolled in 3 credits): Please turn in no later than Tuesday October 22, 2024 (in class). Please print your assignment and hand it in to me.</p>
<p>For this assignment, choose a morpho-phonological data set and provide an analysis of it. Your analysis should formalize the analysis using the logical transductions we have studied in class. Chapters 7 through 14 in Part 2 of DCP/DPC are samples of the kind of short paper expected. It is not necessary to compare your formalization to some other framework. It is necessary to be clear about the representations you are positing in the underlying and surface forms.</p>
<p>You <strong>may not choose</strong> one of the datasets in chapters 7 through 14 (unless you are proposing a radically different analysis.) You <strong>may choose</strong> a dataset you have previously analyzed using a different set of formal tools (such as with rules or OT). For example, datasets from Phonology 1 or 2 can be used, or even a dataset from an undergraduate phonology class or introductory textbook. You may choose a dataset you have collected, but such original research is not the purpose of this assignment, and may be more appropriate for a final project.</p>

<li>We discussed the Chapter up to 2.6. In particular, how the successor model of strings, with and without features, can be combined with FO logic to provides a way to define well-formedness constraints.
