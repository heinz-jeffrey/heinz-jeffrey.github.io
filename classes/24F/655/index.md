# Course Log

## 26 Sep 2024

* A few more words were said about suffix substitution closure,
  subsequence closure, and tier-based successor signatures.
* We then discussed BUFIA, using [slides from a
  minicourse](https://www.jeffreyheinz.net/talks/Heinz-2021-minicourse-LCORYOC-slides.pdf)
  a few years back.
* Next week, please read chapters 9-12 in DCP/DPC and support your
  classmates as they present!

## 24 Sep 2024

* We finished discussing chapter 5.
* On Thursday we will review the BUFIA learning algorithm in [this
  paper](https://aclanthology.org/W19-5708/).

## 19 Sep 2024

* We discussed section 5.1 and 5.2.
* We made a plan for the next few weeks.
  - Oct 1: Presentation on chapter 9 Lamba by Ola
  - Oct 1: Presentation on chapter 10 Turkish by Geonhee
  - Oct 3: Presentation on chapter 11 Tibetan by Elizabeth
  - Oct 3: Presentation on chapter 12 Zigula and Shambaa by Shigeto
* For Tuesday, please finish reading chapter 5.

## 17 Sep 2024

* We finished discussing Chapter 3.
* Upated DCP/DPC [Parts 1 and 2](materials/dcpParts1-2.pdf)

## 12 Sep 2024

* We discussed logical transductions as they can be applied to phonological processes.
* We got through the deletion example in Chapter 3.

## 07 Sep 2024

* We finished discussing Chapter 2.
* If you are interested in attending the [Rutgers workshop on
  subregular
  phoonology](https://rucll.github.io/workshop2024/index.html), please
  let me know this week.
* For Thursday, please finish read up to Chapter 3.3 in [Part
  1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of DCP/DPC.

## 05 Sep 2024

* We discussed the Chapter up to 2.6. In particular, how the successor
  model of strings, with and without features, can be combined with FO
  logic to provides a way to define well-formedness constraints. The
  representational primitives can be thought of as claims regarding
  the psychologically real primitives. They are the aspects of the
  representation that can be "looked up" for free.
* For Tuesday, please finish reading chapter 2 in [Part
  1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of DCP/DPC. (Note it has been updated
  **again** to fix more errors).

## 03 Sep 2024

* We discussed Chapter 1 and began discussion of models of strings and
  FO logic in Chapter 2.
* For Thursday, please read up to section 2.6 (p.43) in [Part
  1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of DCP/DPC. (Note it has been updated to
  fix some errors).

## 29 Aug 2024

* We finished the Phonology Forum talk. Next Tuesday we discuss
  Chapter 1.

## 27 Aug 2024

* We went over the [syllabus](materials/LIN655_Syllabus_Fall2024.pdf).
* As an overview of the class, I presented [a
  talk](materials/forum24-Heinz.pdf) I gave last week at the Phonology
  Forum sponsored by the Phonological Society of Japan.
* Here is [Part 1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of "Doing Computational
  Phonology"/"Doing Phonology, Computationally".
* For Thursday, please read Chapter 1 of Part 1.
