# Course Log

## 05 Nov 2024

* Class Canceled. Office Hour by
  [Zoom](https://stonybrook.zoom.us/my/jeffreyheinz) to catch up and
  ask questions if needed.

## 31 Oct 2024

* We discussed ISL functions, ISL transductions, and QF(succ,pred) functions.
* Here is the draft chapter of ["Logical Perspectives on Strictly Local
  Transformations"](materials/dcpChap22.pdf) by Chandlee and Lindell.

## 29 Oct 2024

* Using this [handout](materials/learning2.pdf), we formally
  introduced two learning criteria: identification in the limit from
  positive data and PAC.
* We discussed compared the two frameworks and thought about what
  choices in a learning criterion make it easier or harder.
* Supporting reading material: ["Computational Theories of Learning
  and Developmental Psycholinguistics" (Heinz
  2016)](http://jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Heinz-2016-CTLDP.pdf)
* Please read ["Strict Locality and Phonological Maps" (Chandlee and
  Heinz
  2018)](http://jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Chandlee-Heinz-2018-SLPM.pdf)
  for Thursday.
* Also, we had some discussion about computable and noncomputable real
 numbers. This [recent summary from the
 ACM](https://mathvoices.ams.org/featurecolumn/2021/12/01/alan-turing-computable-numbers/)
 reviews some of the issues. This paper ["How real are real
 numbers"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0411418) is a bit more in depth.


## 24 Oct 2024

* We continued our discussion of learning problems, and developed one
  related to learning strictly k-local languages. Those techniques
  have been generalized and developed in the papers [String Extension
  Learning](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P10-1092) and [Learning
  with Lattice-Structured Hypothesis
  Spaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397512007128). See
  also [Typology emerges from simplicity in representations and
  learning](https://jlm.ipipan.waw.pl/index.php/JLM/article/view/262).

* On November 7, Jack will present [Computing and classifying
  reduplication with 2-way finite-state
  transducers](https://jlm.ipipan.waw.pl/index.php/JLM/article/view/245). Then
  Anton will present [Computational universals in linguistic theory:
  Using recursive programs for phonological
  analysis](materials/ChandleeJardine2021.pdf).


## 22 Oct 2024

* We discussed [related work
  (references)](materials/relatedwork.pdf). Students were asked to
  review those papers and think about which ones they would be
  interested in for class.
* We began discussing how to formulate learning problems. [Learning
  handout 1](materials/learning1.pdf)

  Nonlexical Stress Patterns.

  presentation.

* Logan presented Chapter 18 on Phonetically-based Phonology.
* Next Thursday Oct 15, Alina will present Chapter 19 Representations
  of Gradual Oppositions.

* Elizabeth presented Chapter on Tibetan.


## 01 Oct 2024

* **Short Paper Assignment** (for students enrolled in 3 credits):
  Please turn in no later than Tuesday October 22, 2024 (in
  class). Please print your assignment and hand it in to me.

  For this assignment, choose a morpho-phonological data set and
  provide an analysis of it. Your analysis should formalize the
  analysis using the logical transductions we have studied in
  class. Chapters 7 through 14 in Part 2 of DCP/DPC are samples of the
  kind of short paper expected. It is not necessary to compare your
  formalization to some other framework. It is necessary to be clear
  about the representations you are positing in the underlying and
  surface forms.

  You **may not choose** one of the datasets in chapters 7 through 14
  (unless you are proposing a radically different analysis.) You **may
  choose** a dataset you have previously analyzed using a different
  set of formal tools (such as with rules or OT). For example,
  datasets from Phonology 1 or 2 can be used, or even a dataset from
  an undergraduate phonology class or introductory textbook. You may
  choose a dataset you have collected, but such original research is
  not the purpose of this assignment, and may be more appropriate for
  a final project.

  A [collection of tex files](materials/texsupport.tar.gz) providing
  macros and examples for your convenience. I commpiled the pdf in
  there with the command `latexmk dolatian-russian.tex`.

* Ola presented Chapter 9 on Lamba.
* Geonhee presented Chapter 10 on Turkish.

* We developed a plan for next week. [Updated DCP/DPC text here](materials/dcpChaps1-20.pdf)

## 26 Sep 2024

* A few more words were said about suffix substitution closure,
  subsequence closure, and tier-based successor signatures.
* We then discussed BUFIA, using [slides from a
  minicourse](https://www.jeffreyheinz.net/talks/Heinz-2021-minicourse-LCORYOC-slides.pdf)
  a few years back.
* Next week, please read chapters 9-12 in DCP/DPC and support your
  classmates as they present!

## 24 Sep 2024

* We finished discussing chapter 5.
* On Thursday we will review the BUFIA learning algorithm in [this
  paper](https://aclanthology.org/W19-5708/).

## 17 Sep 2024

* We finished discussing Chapter 3.
* Upated DCP/DPC [Parts 1 and 2](materials/dcpParts1-2.pdf)

## 12 Sep 2024

* We discussed logical transductions as they can be applied to phonological processes.
* We got through the deletion example in Chapter 3.

## 07 Sep 2024

* We finished discussing Chapter 2.
* If you are interested in attending the [Rutgers workshop on
  subregular
  phoonology](https://rucll.github.io/workshop2024/index.html), please
  let me know this week.
* For Thursday, please finish read up to Chapter 3.3 in [Part
  1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of DCP/DPC.

## 05 Sep 2024

* We discussed the Chapter up to 2.6. In particular, how the successor
  model of strings, with and without features, can be combined with FO
  logic to provides a way to define well-formedness constraints. The
  representational primitives can be thought of as claims regarding
  the psychologically real primitives. They are the aspects of the
  representation that can be "looked up" for free.
* For Tuesday, please finish reading chapter 2 in [Part
  1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of DCP/DPC. (Note it has been updated
  **again** to fix more errors).

## 03 Sep 2024

* We discussed Chapter 1 and began discussion of models of strings and
  FO logic in Chapter 2.
* For Thursday, please read up to section 2.6 (p.43) in [Part
  1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of DCP/DPC. (Note it has been updated to
  fix some errors).

* We finished the Phonology Forum talk. Next Tuesday we discuss
  Chapter 1.

## 27 Aug 2024

* We went over the [syllabus](materials/LIN655_Syllabus_Fall2024.pdf).
* As an overview of the class, I presented [a
  talk](materials/forum24-Heinz.pdf) I gave last week at the Phonology
  Forum sponsored by the Phonological Society of Japan.
* Here is [Part 1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of "Doing Computational
  Phonology"/"Doing Phonology, Computationally".
* For Thursday, please read Chapter 1 of Part 1.
