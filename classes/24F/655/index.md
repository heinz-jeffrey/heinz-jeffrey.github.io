# Course Log

## 05 Sep 2024

* We discussed the Chapter up to 2.6. In particular, how the successor
  model of strings, with and without features, can be combined with FO
  logic to provides a way to define well-formedness constraints. The
  representational primitives can be thought of as claims regarding
  the psychologically real primitives. They are the aspects of the
  representation that can be "looked up" for free.
* For Tuesday, please finish reading chapter 2 in [Part
  1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of DCP/DPC. (Note it has been updated
  **again** to fix more errors).

## 03 Sep 2024

* We discussed Chapter 1 and began discussion of models of strings and
  FO logic in Chapter 2.
* For Thursday, please read up to section 2.6 (p.43) in [Part
  1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of DCP/DPC. (Note it has been updated to
  fix some errors).

## 29 Aug 2024

* We finished the Phonology Forum talk. Next Tuesday we discuss
  Chapter 1.

## 27 Aug 2024

* We went over the [syllabus](materials/LIN655_Syllabus_Fall2024.pdf).
* As an overview of the class, I presented [a
  talk](materials/forum24-Heinz.pdf) I gave last week at the Phonology
  Forum sponsored by the Phonological Society of Japan.
* Here is [Part 1](materials/dcpPart1.pdf) of "Doing Computational
  Phonology"/"Doing Phonology, Computationally".
* For Thursday, please read Chapter 1 of Part 1.
