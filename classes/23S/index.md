## 01 Mar 2023

* We examined the arguments made by [Hyman 2011 on
  tone](materials/Hyman-2011-Tone-is-it-different.pdf).

  little bit more.
* For Wednesday, please read [Hyman 2011 on
  tone](materials/Hyman-2011-Tone-is-it-different.pdf), and map out
  the argument structure of this chapter.

## 22 Feb 2023

* Some revised deadlines: 1-1s to discuss potential projects should be
  completed by March 3 and project proposals are due by March 31.
* We discussed 2.1 of [McCarthy 2008
  Doing OT](materials/McCarthy2008-DoingOT.pdf)
* We observed a parallel between McCarthy's highlighting of linguistic
  generalizations in analysis development and the "verbal" and
  "formal" in [Rooij and Baggio 2021](materials/RooijBaggio2021.pdf)
  (see figure).
* Squib 3 on [Ilokano](materials/HW03-Ilokano.pdf) is due Friday March 24, 2023.
* We discussed some of the linguistic generalizations in Ilokano.


## 20 Feb 2023

* We finished discussing [Vaux's (2008) critique of
  OT](materials/VauxNevins2008.pdf), in particular optionality,
  ineffability, unnaturalness, and the "too many solutions" problem.
* For next class, read sections 2.1 and chapter 3 of [McCarthy 2008
  Doing OT](materials/McCarthy2008-DoingOT.pdf)

## 15 Feb 2023

* Class cancelled; instructor ill.

## 13 Feb 2023

* We had some Q&A about the assignment due Wednesday.
* We had some discussion about descriptive and explanatory goals and what counts as descriptive and/or explanatory.
* Jeff questioned whether intermediary representations are necessary to account for opaque patterns contra McCarthy's (2008) claim.
* We began reviewing [Vaux's (2008) critique of OT](materials/VauxNevins2008.pdf), identified his main objections, and began talking specifically about his critique of OT wrt optionality.
* To do: complete reading Vaux's chapter by next Monday.

## 08 Feb 2023

* We finished discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf) in
  particular the following approaches to opacity in OT:
  harmonic serialism and stratal OT.

## 06 Feb 2023

* We discussed some lessons from squib 1.
* We continued discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf) in
  particular the following approaches to opacity in OT:
  representational, local constraint conjunction, and 2-level constraints.
* On Wed we will discuss harmonic serialism, stratal OT, sympathy
  theory, contrast preservation.
* Also note: on the [Polish assignment](materials/HW02-Polish.pdf)
  there was a typo: the nom.pl. of 'room' is not [pokoji]. The HW has
  been fixed. You only need to account for the alternations in the
  noun stems. You do not need to account for the alternations in the
  plural suffix.

## 01 Feb 2023

* We continued discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf).

  distribution and lexicon optimization, and discussed its implications
  for phonemes.
* We continued discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf).
* For Wednesday: finish reading this chapter and squib 1 is due.

## 25 Jan 2023
* We finished discussing the [introduction to phonology](materials/01-intro.pdf).
* We began discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters 1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf).

  notes which identify McCarthy's main points and identify questions
  to raise in class on Monday.
* FYI we will finish reading this chapter by Wednesday if you want a
  head start (reminder squib 1 is due then too).

## 23 Jan 2023

* We went over the syllabus.
* We went over this [introduction to phonology](materials/01-intro.pdf).
