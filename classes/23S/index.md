# Course Log


## 13 Feb 2023

* We had some Q&A about the assignment due Wednesday.
* We had some discussion about descriptive and explanatory goals and what counts as descriptive and/or explanatory.
* Jeff questioned whether intermediary representations are necessary to account for opaque patterns contra McCarthy's (2008) claim.
* We began reviewing [Vaux's (2008) critique of OT](materials/VauxNevins2008.pdf), identified his main objections, and began talking specifically about his critique of OT wrt optionality.
* To do: complete reading Vaux's chapter by next Monday.

## 08 Feb 2023

* We finished discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf) in
  particular the following approaches to opacity in OT:
  harmonic serialism and stratal OT.

## 06 Feb 2023

* We discussed some lessons from squib 1.
* We continued discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf) in
  particular the following approaches to opacity in OT:
  representational, local constraint conjunction, and 2-level constraints.
* On Wed we will discuss harmonic serialism, stratal OT, sympathy
  theory, contrast preservation.
* Also note: on the [Polish assignment](materials/HW02-Polish.pdf)
  there was a typo: the nom.pl. of 'room' is not [pokoji]. The HW has
  been fixed. You only need to account for the alternations in the
  noun stems. You do not need to account for the alternations in the
  plural suffix.

## 01 Feb 2023

* We continued discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf).

## 30 Jan 2023
* We reviewed [Kager's (1999) sections 1.5 and 1.6](materials/Kager1999-Ch01.pdf) on complementary
  distribution and lexicon optimization, and discussed its implications
  for phonemes.
* We continued discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf).
* For Wednesday: finish reading this chapter and squib 1 is due.

## 25 Jan 2023
* We finished discussing the [introduction to phonology](materials/01-intro.pdf).
* We began discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters 1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf).
* For Monday, read McCarthy 2007 through page 36 up to 2.3.4.2. Take
  notes which identify McCarthy's main points and identify questions
  to raise in class on Monday.
* FYI we will finish reading this chapter by Wednesday if you want a
  head start (reminder squib 1 is due then too).
