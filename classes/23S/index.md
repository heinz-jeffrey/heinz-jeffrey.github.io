# Course Log


## 03 Feb 2023

* We discussed some lessons from squib 1.
* We continued discussing [McCarthy 2007, chapters
  1-2](materials/McCarthy-Hidden-Generalizations-Ch1-2.pdf) in
  particular the following approaches to opacity in OT:
  representational, local constraint conjunction, and 2-level constraints.
* On Wed we will discuss harmonic serialism, stratal OT, sympathy
  theory, contrast preservation.
* Also note: on the [Polish assignment](materials/HW02-Polish.pdf)
  there was a typo: the nom.pl. of 'room' is not [pokoji]. The HW has
  been fixed. You only need to account for the alternations in the
  noun stems. You do not need to account for the alternations in the
  plural suffix.
