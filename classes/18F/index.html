<h3>Course Log</h3>


<h4>15 Oct 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> I reviewed the current python file for English plurals: [<a href="materials/EngPlurals.py">EngPlurals.py</a>]. </li>
  <li> Today we discussed how Roark and Sproat analyze the morphomic level with regular relations. </li>
  <li> Today we also began discussing reduplication. </li>
</ul>

  <li> Homework
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about text with bytes vs. unicode: <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html">https://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html</a></li>
      <li> Install pynini with python3.
	<ul>
	  <li><tt>sudo apt-get install python3-dev</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>sudo python3 setup.py install</tt></li>
	</ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>08 Oct 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Fall Break. No class.</li>
</ul>

<h4>03 Oct 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Here
  is <a href="materials/installation.pdf">installation.pdf</a>, which
  explains how to set up the CompLingLab's Virtual Machine, and then
    install openfst and pynini onto it.</li>
  <li>For next Wednesday, your goal is to install this software
  successfully.</li>
</ul>

<h4>01 Oct 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> We discussed pages 29-35 in RS2007 where the concept of morpheme as a transformation/regular relation is shown to handle prosodic circumscription and prosodic governance.</li>
  <li> On Wednesday, the following students will present the material from the following subsections: 2.2.4 (Andrija), 2.2.5 (Ji Yea), 2.2.6 (Alex), 2.2.7 (Kalina), 2.2.8 (Jon).</li>
  <li> Ali and Andrija volunteered to present 2.2.10, and we are still looking for volunteers for 2.2.9, 2.3, and 2.4.</li>
  <li> Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle Virtual Box</a> on your computer if you don't have any VMware installed already.</li>
</ul>

<h4>26 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Ali and Ayla presented
  [<a href="materials/Karttunen1993-Finite-state-Constraints.pdf">Karttunen1993.pdf</a>]
  on intermediate representations and 2-level morpho-phonology.</li>
  <li>We discussed the different ways a complex regular relation can be factored into simpler ones.</li>
</ul>

<h4>24 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> We reviewed the definition of composition carefully.</li>
  <li> We saw how the composition of a lexical item as a regular
  relation with a morpheme as a regular relation results in regular
  relation representing the form of the original item subject to the
  morphological process.</li>
</ul>


<h4>19 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> We discussed pages 27-29 in RS2007 where the notion of morpheme as a transformation/regular relation is introduced. </li>
  <li> For next Monday: consider the regular relation L = {(kat,kat)} (L is for lexicon) and the regular relation P = [ID][e:z] (where P is for Plural, [ID] is the identity relation, e is epsilon, and z is the phoneme 'z'). Following Lothaire's definition carefully, compute both P o L and L o P. [<a href="materials/kaet.pdf">kaet.pdf</a>]</li>
  <li> For next Wednesday: Read [<a href="materials/Karttunen1993-Finite-state-Constraints.pdf">Karttunen1993.pdf</a>] on intermediate representations and 2-level morpho-phonology. It's chapter 6 of [<a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3641769.html">The Last Phonological Rule</a>].</li>
</ul>



<h4>17 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> We went carefully through an example of transducer composition. </li>
  <li> We explained why transducers are not closed under intersection [<a href="materials/BeesleyKartunnen-2003-pp54-56.pdf">pp.54-57 in BK2003</a>].</li>
  <li> For next class: read pages 23-31 of Roark and Sproat 2007.</li>
  <li> Bonus reading: [<a href="materials/Karttunen1993-Finite-state-Constraints.pdf">Karttunen1993.pdf</a> on intermediate representations and 2-level morpho-phonology. It's chapter 6 of [<a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3641769.html">The Last Phonological Rule</a>].</li>
</ul>

<h4>12 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> We had some discussion regarding questions from the readings.</li>
  <li> We explained how product constructions for regular langugae intersection and union as well as regular transduction composition. [<a href="materials/cm03.pdf">cm03.pdf</a>] </li>
  <li> For next class: write out the product construction which gives the composition of the two literal transducers A and B in the handout at the bottom of page 2.</li>
</ul>

<h4>10 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Tony presented <a href="materials/RE-Negation.pdf">slides</a> showing examples of the use of regular expressions in every day programming.</li>
  <li> We reviewed the automata product which computes intersection.</li>
  <li> We introduced the idea behind transducer composition.</li>
  <li> Read for next class: pages 40-44 on transducer composition from Lothaire, and pages 47-50 from Sipser on non-determinism.</li>
</ul>

<h4>05 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Instructor away at <a href="http://icgi2018.pwr.edu.pl/">ICGI</a>. No class.</li>
  <li>Read about this research from the <a href="materials/Dolatian-Heinz-2018-LRW2FST.pdf">PMLR proceedings paper here!</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>03 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Labor Day. No class.</li>
</ul>

<h4>29 Aug 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Today we went over regular expressions (REs), generalized regular expressions (GREs), star-free expressions (SFE), and "cat-union" expressions. [<a href="materials/cm02.pdf">cm02.pdf</a>]</li>
  <li>We introduced epsilon transitions, which have an epsilon on the input side, and discussed how they also introduce non-determinism.</li>
  <li> We mentioned the following theorems.
    <ul>
      <li>Kleene's theorem: The formal languages (sets of strings)
      describable with regular expressions are exactly the ones
      recognizable by finite-state acceptors.</li>
      <li>The formal languages recognizable with non-deterministic
      acceptors are exactly the ones recognizable with determinisitc
      finite-state acceptors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With the epsilon transitions, we explained how finite-state
  acceptors are closed under union, concatenation, and Kleene
  star.</li>
  <li>Assignment 2, due Monday September 10
    <ul>
      <li>read page 13 of Roark and Sproat and study the definition of acceptor product.</li>
      <li>Do the following:
	<ol>
	  <li> Write down two acceptors. (For example: one which recognizes all strings without 2 consecutive "a"s and one which recognizes all strings with an odd number of "b"s.) Each acceptor should have at least two states.</li>
	  <li> Calculate the acceptor product using the definition.
	  <li> We will go over some of your work in class and I will collect it.</li>
	  <li> Here is an <a href="materials/product-example.pdf">example answer</a> that would receive full credit.</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>Re-read the assigned pages from last time and come to class prepared to ask questions.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>


<h4>27 Aug 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li>First day of class!</li>
  <li>Today we went over how weighted transducers map strings to values [<a href="materials/cm01.pdf">cm01.pdf</a>].</li>
  <li>Assignment 1, due Wednesday:
    <ol>
      <li>read the brief entry by Stephen Anderson on morphology</li>
      
      <li>read pages 1-12 and pages 23-27 of Roark and Sproat. It is NOT important to understand EVERYTHING! Instead, try to recognize in pages 1-12 some of the things we talked about in class today. Yes, we will discuss it on Wednesday </li>
      
      <li> do the four sets of four problems each in the today's handout. These are on pages 2 and 3 subtitled Boolean, Counting, Probability, and String Transducers. Draw out the paths!!</li>
  </ol></li>
