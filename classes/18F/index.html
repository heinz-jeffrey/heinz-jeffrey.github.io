<h3>Course Log</h3>

<h4>05 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Instructor away at ICGI. No class.</li>
  <li>Read about this research from the <a href="materials/Dolatian-Heinz-2018-LRW2FST.pdf">preprint here!</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>03 Sep 2018</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Labor Day. No class.</li>
</ul>

<h4>29 Aug 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Today we went over regular expressions (REs), generalized regular expressions (GREs), star-free expressions (SFE), and "cat-union" expressions. <a href="materials/cm02.pdf">Slide summary</a></li>
  <li>We introduced epsilon transitions, which have an epsilon on the input side, and discussed how they also introduce non-determinism.</li>
  <li> We mentioned the following theorems.
    <ul>
      <li>Kleene's theorem: The formal languages (sets of strings)
      describable with regular expressions are exactly the ones
      recognizable by finite-state acceptors.</li>
      <li>The formal languages recognizable with non-deterministic
      acceptors are exactly the ones recognizable with determinisitc
      finite-state acceptors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With the epsilon transitions, we explained how finite-state
  acceptors are closed under union, concatenation, and Kleene
  star.</li>
  <li>Assignment 2, due Monday September 10
    <ul>
      <li>read page 13 of Roark and Sproat and study the definition of acceptor product.</li>
      <li>Do the following:
	<ol>
	  <li> Write down two acceptors. (For example: one which recognizes all strings without 2 consecutive "a"s and one which recognizes all strings with an odd number of "b"s.) Each acceptor should have at least two states.</li>
	  <li> Calculate the acceptor product using the definition.
	  <li> We will go over some of your work in class and I will collect it.</li>
	  <li> Here is an <a href="materials/product-example.pdf">example answer</a> that would receive full credit.</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>Re-read the assigned pages from last time and come to class prepared to ask questions.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>


<h4>27 Aug 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li>First day of class!</li>
  <li>Today we went over how weighted transducers map strings to values [<a href="materials/cm01.pdf">cm01.pdf</a>].</li>
  <li>Assignment 1, due Wednesday:
    <ol>
      <li>read the brief entry by Stephen Anderson on morphology</li>
      
      <li>read pages 1-12 and pages 23-27 of Roark and Sproat. It is NOT important to understand EVERYTHING! Instead, try to recognize in pages 1-12 some of the things we talked about in class today. Yes, we will discuss it on Wednesday </li>
      
      <li> do the four sets of four problems each in the today's handout. These are on pages 2 and 3 subtitled Boolean, Counting, Probability, and String Transducers. Draw out the paths!!</li>
  </ol></li>
</ul>
