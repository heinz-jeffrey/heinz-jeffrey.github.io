<h3>Course Log</h3>


<h4>04 Apr 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We provided a definition for k-factors of arbitrary relational
  structures in addition to a propositional logic of which the
  k-factors are the atomic propositions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> We went over 1.3 of the Kearns and Vazirani chapter on
  PAC-learning the class of concepts expressible with conjunctions of

<h4>26 Mar 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <li>Our guest
  lecturer <a href="http://pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~remi.eyraud/en/index.html">R&eacute;mi

<h4>28 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Ji Yea presented her research on optionality in Korean
    etymological i-epenthesis and how it might be modeled as an OSL or
    as an ISL function.</li>
  <li> Hossep began talking about his research on reduplication with
    2-way deterministic finite-state transducers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>26 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Nazila presented her research on how the tree languages
    representing well-formed binding relations not be well described
    with dominance and successor models of trees, but that it may be
    more straightforward with c-command as a primitive relation (Frank
    and Vijay-Shankar, 2001).</li>
  <li> Lei also presented his work on binding relations from the
  perspectibe Bruening's precede and command perspective.</li>
