<h3>Course Log</h3>


<h4>05 Mar 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Hossep completed his presentation, which included discussion of
    how reduplication patterns can be learned.</li>
    <li> We discussed the VC dimension in anticipation of our lesson
      on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning on Wednesday.</li>
  <li> Readings. Please read up to section 1.3 in Kearns and Vazirani 1994 for Wednesday. It's OK to skim pages 4-6 and 12-14.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="materials/Kearns-Vairani-1994-Introduction-to-Computational-Learning-Thoery-Ch01.pdf">Chapter 1, Kearns and Vazirani 1994</a></li>
      <li><a href="materials/Mohri%20Rostamizadeh%20Talwalk%202012%20Foundations%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Chap%201.pdf">Chapter 1, Mohri et al 2012</a></li>
      <li><a href="materials/Mohri%20Rostamizadeh%20Talwalk%202012%20Foundations%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Chap%202.pdf">Chapter 2, Mohri et al 2012</a></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>





<h4>28 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Ji Yea presented her research on optionality in Korean
    etymological i-epenthesis and how it might be modeled as an OSL or
    as an ISL function.</li>
  <li> Hossep began talking about his research on reduplication with
    2-way deterministic finite-state transducers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>26 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Nazila presented her research on how the tree languages
    representing well-formed binding relations not be well described
    with dominance and successor models of trees, but that it may be
    more straightforward with c-command as a primitive relation (Frank
    and Vijay-Shankar, 2001).</li>
  <li> Lei also presented his work on binding relations from the
  perspectibe Bruening's precede and command perspective.</li>
</ul>

<h4>21 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We
  discussed <a href="materials/02-relational-learning-factors.pdf">this
  handout</a> on using relational learning to identify smallest
  factors consistent with a most specific hypothesis which covers the
  data.</li>
</ul>


<h4>19 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We discussed chapter 3 of De Raedt's book.</li>
  <li> Jon presented his project on learning feature-based constraints in the context of this chapter.</li>
</ul>



<h4>14 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Hongchen presented her ideas on lifting OSL funnctions from strings to trees and we discussed what syntactic phenomena may be described in this way, if any.</li>
  <li>We began discussion of Chapter 3 of De Raedt 2008 in anticipation of Jon's presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>12 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We went over <a href="materials/01-dtts.pdf">deterministic bottom-up tree transducers</a> in anticipation of Hongchen's presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>07 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We discussed the constraints definable with first order logic and precedence. </li>
  <li> Reading for Wednesday Feb 14.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="materials/De%20Raedt%202008%20Chapter03.pdf">Chapter 3</a> of De Raedt's 2008 book Logical and Relational Learning </li>
      <li><a href="materials/De%20Raedt%202008%20FrontMatter.pdf">Front matter</a> of De Raedt's 2008 book Logical and Relational Learning </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4>05 Feb 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Class cancelled; instructor away.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>31 Jan 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We discussed the successor model with features</li>
  <li>Aniello presented the sections on MSO logic.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>29 Jan 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Class now meets MW 4:00 to 5:20pm in the compling lab (SBS N250).</li>
  <li> We discussed how to write constraints using the successor model and FO logic.</li>
  <li> Reading for next class on successor model with features and MSO logic: <a href="materials/dcp-ch02.5-ch02.7.pdf">chapter 2, DCP, sections 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7</a>. It is a rough first draft! Please send typos etc and higher level comments to Hossep, who will compile and give to me.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>25 Jan 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We finished going over the handout from last class.</li>
  <li> Reading for next class on successor model and FO logic: <a href="materials/dcp-ch02-ch02.4.pdf">chapter 2, DCP, up to section 2.5</a>. It is a rough first draft! Please send typos etc and higher level comments to Hossep, who will compile and give to me.</li>
 </ul>



<h4>23 Jan 2018</h4>

<ul>
  <li> We reviewed the syllabus and introduced the course.</li>
  <li> We discussed the time and location of class. It may change to MW 4-5:20pm, but next class will be 8:30-9:50am in the compling lab (SBS N250).</li>
