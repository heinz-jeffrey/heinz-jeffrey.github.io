<ul>
<li>We discussed Chapter 2 of McCarthy 2008. Consider the following excerpts. Do you Agree or Disagree and Why?
<ul>
<li>p. 32. McCarthy writes “For a phonologist to try to analyze all of the alternations in the Latin third declension is a bit like a syntactician trying to analyze all of the six-word sentences in a language. The task isn’t meaningful.”</li>
<li>p. 32. “Which phenomena make good research topics? […] The phenomenon should be reasonably self-contained. A pretty good test of this is whether the scope of the project can be described in a single sentence that uses only the terminology of the field in which the paper is being written.” Agree or Disagree and why?</li>
<li>p. 33. “In OT, nonuniformity is always a consequence of constraint interaction, as we saw with the Yawelmani example in §1.6.”<br />
</li>
<li>p. 33. “A <i>descriptive generalization</i> is the essential intermediate step between data and analysis. Good descriptive generalizations are accurate characterizations of the systematic patterns that can be observed in the data. They may not require any formalization or theoretical constructs beyond the usual linguistic terminology […] Proceeding straight from the data to the analysis, without taking time to formulate an accurate descriptive generalization, is never a good idea.”<br />
</li>
<li>p. 34. “A good descriptive generalization will foreshadow the analysis. An excellent descriptive generalization will make the analysis seem almost inevitable.”</li>
<li>p.34. “Ideally, descriptive generalizations [developed for an OT analysis] will contain statements about target output configurations and unfaithful mappings related to those configurations.”</li>
<li>p. 37. “When the data involve phonological alternations, start with the faithfulness constraints. They are the best place to start because faith- fulness constraints are more limited in variety and better understood than markedness constraints.”</li>
<li>p. 38. “OT itself does not say much about constraints, but it says that there are only two types of them: constraints that evaluate individual output forms, and constraints that require individual output forms to be identical to their inputs.”</li>
<li>p. 39. “The danger with an insufficiently precise constraint definition is that the interpretation and hence the effect of the constraint can vary slightly as the analysis progresses.”</li>
<li>p. 42. “Because ranking arguments are so important, it’s unwise to claim rankings without first doing the arguments needed to back them up.”</li>
<li>p. 43. “Occasionally, someone will object: “Max &gt;&gt; Dep &gt;&gt; Onset isn’t exactly wrong. Since it just overspecifies the known rankings, it’s completely consistent with the data.” Regardless of whether it’s “wrong,” it’s unwise to assert rankings for which there is no support."</li>
<li>p. 47 “The combination tableau is the ideal instrument for constructing and presenting ranking arguments, and we will be using it for that purpose throughout this book.”</li>
<li>p. 48 “We now have two main tableau formats [violation and comparative]. Brasoveanu and Prince (2005: 3–5) have a good way of explaining which tableau format to use depend- ing on the situation. They distinguish between the ranking problem and the selection problem. The comparative or combination format is best for the ranking problem, whereas the violation format is best for the selection problem.”</li>
<li>p. 49. "Sometimes, however, the known information about ranking cannot be accurately represented in a tableau, even with the aid of the broken-line convention. […] [On the other hand, ] The Hasse diagram (12) accurately represents the known rankings.</li>
<li>p. 54 (Doing an analysis). “The first step in the analysis is to formulate OT-friendly descriptive generalizations …”</li>
<li>p. 55 (Doing an analysis). “We could interrupt the analysis at this point to research the topic of syllable-structure constraints, but a better move is to put the matter aside and simply formulate an ad hoc constraint that is violated by any syllable that is too big.”</li>
<li>p. 55 (Doing an analysis). “Now that we have a hypothesis about the constraints that are involved, we can move on to the ranking. It’s easiest to begin the ranking process with a faithfulness violation.”</li>
<li>p. 57 (Doing an analysis). “In general, whenever a constraint is introduced into an analysis, its potential effects on all existing claims about ranking need to be considered.”</li>
<li>p. 60 (Doing an analysis). “Since we have now completed an initial pass through the entire descriptive generalization, it’s appropriate to summarize the proven rankings in (25) and assess the overall analysis.”</li>
<li>p. 60 (Doing an analysis). “The next step is to check all of the pairs of constraints that aren’t ranked with respect to one another. Do these constraints ever conflict? If so, the analysis is incomplete until they have been ranked. Checking all of the pairs of unranked constraints is an excellent way of discovering interactions that we might have overlooked.”</li>
<li>p. 63 (Doing an analysis). “The best way to [chack that all of the original data have been correctly analyzed] is with sum- mary tableaux that challenge the full constraint hierarchy with all of the relevant inputs and candidates.”</li>
<li>p. 71. “We have seen that there are three circumstances where direct ranking arguments are impossible: undominated constraints, constraints in a stringency relationship, and constraints that only break ties. This doesn’t exhaust the possibilities”</li>
<li>p. 72. “Figuring out which losing candidates need to be considered is probably the hardest thing about doing analysis in OT. There are two aspects of this problem, one arising in the early stages of analysis and the other arising later on. In the early stages, losing candidates are needed for the ranking arguments that emerge from our descriptive generalizations. In the later stages, the analysis needs to be challenged with losing candidates that might reveal its inadequacies.”</li>
<li>p. 73 "Given a suspected constraint ranking Const1 &gt;&gt; Const2 and a winner [w], we want to find a loser *[l] to prove the ranking. Starting from [w], eliminate one or more Const2 violations and add one or more Const1 violations with- out adding violations of any other constraints, except for those that are already known to be ranked below C ONST 1."</li>
<li>p. 75 “[…] a constraint introduced later in the process of analysis can cast a shadow on a ranking argument that had previously been OK. That is why it’s so important to do summary tableaux like (31)–(34). Summary tableaux provide a final check on the soundness of the analysis.”</li>
<li>p. 76 “As Karttunen says, “The specter of an unexpected competitor suddenly emerging to eliminate the desired winner is the bane of OT analyses.” […] Karttunen’s solution is to take the problem out of the hands of the analyst by implementing a candidate-generation algorithm (like Gen, but more limited) and using the grammar to check all of the resulting candidates against the intended winner. […] The weakness of this analytic technique is that it’s only as good as the algorithm that generates the candidates."</li>
<li>p. 82 “Harmonic bounding is important for three reasons. First, harmonically bounded candidates need to be recognized as a potential distraction from the task of ranking constraints…. Second, discovering that the intended winner is harmonically bounded by some loser is a serious problem. Third, harmonic bounding is important in studying language typology.”</li>

<h2 id="feb-1">04 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today we discussed in more detail an OT analysis for the Ilokano assignment. We discussed harmonic bounding, how to make ranking arguments using entailed ranking conditions (W/L/e), how to interpret rows of W/L/e more generally, markedness hierarchies, and a couple different ways to handle optionality.</li>
<li>Finish reading chapter 2 for Thursday.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jan-2025">30 Jan 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>We discussed the first three sections of Chapter 1 (McCarthy 2008).</li>
<li>We began analyzing <a href="materials/Ilokano.pdf">some words in Ilokano</a>. This assignment (squib) is due February 13. Chapter 3 of McCarthy 2008 provides very helpful advice for how to write phonological analysis.</li>
<li>For next Tuesday, finish reading Chapter 1 and read sections 1 and 2 of chapter 2 (McCarthy 2008).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jan-2025-1">28 Jan 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>We went over the <a href="materials/LIN623_Syllabus_Spring2025.pdf">syllabus</a>.</li>
<li>We discussed the <a href="materials/01-intro.pdf">introduction</a> to this course. Please finish reading it before Thursday.</li>
<li>For Thursday, please read sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 of <a href="materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf">McCarthy 2008</a>
<ul>
<li>Section 1.2 asks “Why Must Constraints Be Violable?” Is McCarthy’s argument convincing? Why or why not?</li>
<li>In section 1.3, McCarthy writes “OT itself does not say much about the nature of constraints, beyond distinguishing between markedness and faithfulness. OT is a theory of how constraints interact with one another; it isn’t a theory of what the constraints are, nor is it a theory of representations.” Why do you think this is or isn’t true, and what does it meand for a theory of phonoligy?</li>
