# Phonology 2, Spring 2025, Course Review

## Phase 1 - Optimizing Grammars

1. Classic OT
  * ranking arguments
  * comparative tableaux
  * factorial typology
  * Recursive Constraint Demotion (learning)

2. How to write a phonological analysis
  * descriptive generalizations,
  * formal analysis
  * incremental approach to large or complex analyses

3. Variants of Classic OT
  * Harmonic Serialism
  * Harmonic Grammar and Noisy HG
  * Stratal OT
  * MaxEnt grammars (did not discuss)

4. Critiques of Classic OT
  * Opacity
  * Optionality
  * Ineffability

## Phase 2 - Introducing Computational Analysis via Syllabification

1. Syllabification in Imdlawn Tashlhiyt Berber
  * With rules
  * With Classic OT
  * With Quantifier-Free logical transductions
  * QF analysis reveals local nature of ITB syllabification, which is
    not something visible with globally optmizing grammars.

2. Input and Output Strictly Local Functions
  * Are sufficient to describe many segmental processes
  * are QF transductions over strings (modulo unbounded deletion)
  * Are learnable from positive examples

3. Different logics and representations can be explored
  * Phonotactics and tonotactics with constraint satisfaction as
    opposed to optimization.
  * Phonotactics and tonotactics as the conjunction of negative
    factors: don't contain structure X and don't contain structure Y
    and so on.
  * QF transductions with autosegmental representations
  * Boolean Monadic Recursive Schemes (BMRS, not discussed)


## Phase 3 - Suprasegmental Phonology

1. Stress
  * Quantity Insensitive
  * Quantity Sensitive Bounded
  * Quantity Sensitive Unbounded
  * Quality Sensitive
  * Representations: feet, grid, combos
  * Lexical exceptions (not discussed)

2. Tone
  * Autonomous from segments...
  * ... because it may shift
  * ... because it may persist when its vowel deletes
  * ... because some morphemes are purely tonal
  * Autosegmental Representations and Rules

## Phase 3 - Assorted Topics

1. Harmony
  * Consonant Harmony
  * Vowel Harmony
  * Vowel/Consonant Harmony
  * Transparency and Blocking

2. Abstractness
  * What principles and what evidence licenses an abstract analysis?

3. Phonetics/Phonology Interface
  * How phonetically grounded is phonology?
  * How phonologically grounded is phonetics?
  * Incomplete Neutralizaton
  * Homophone Duration
  * Feed Forward Model (one input to phonetics) and the Blueprint
    Model (multiple inputs to phonetics)
