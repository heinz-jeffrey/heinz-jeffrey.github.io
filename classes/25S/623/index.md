# Course Log


## 30 Jan 2025

* We discussed the first three sections of Chapter 1 (McCarthy 2008).
* We began analyzing [some words in
  Ilokano](materials/Ilokano.pdf). This assignment (squib) is due
  February 13. Chapter 3 of McCarthy 2008 provides very helpful advice
  for how to write phonological analysis.
* For next Tuesday, finish reading Chapter 1 and read sections 1 and 2
  of chapter 2 (McCarthy 2008).

## 28 Jan 2025

* We went over the [syllabus](materials/LIN623_Syllabus_Spring2025.pdf).
* We discussed the [introduction](materials/01-intro.pdf) to this
  course. Please finish reading it before Thursday.
* For Thursday, please read sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 of [McCarthy 2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf)
  - Section 1.2 asks "Why Must Constraints Be Violable?" Is McCarthy's
    argument convincing? Why or why not?
  - In section 1.3, McCarthy writes "OT itself does not say much about
    the nature of constraints, beyond distinguishing between
    markedness and faithfulness. OT is a theory of how constraints
    interact with one another; it isnâ€™t a theory of what the
    constraints are, nor is it a theory of representations." Why do
    you think this is or isn't true, and what does it meand for a
    theory of phonoligy?
