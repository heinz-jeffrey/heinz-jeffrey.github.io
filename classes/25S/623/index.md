# Course Log


## 28 Jan 2025

* We went over the [syllabus](materials/LIN623_Syllabus_Spring2025.pdf).
* We discussed the [introduction](materials/01-intro.pdf) to this
  course. Please finish reading it before Thursday.
* For Thursday, please read sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 of [McCarthy 2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf)
  - Section 1.2 asks "Why Must Constraints Be Violable?" Is McCarthy's
    argument convincing? Why or why not?
  - In section 1.3, McCarthy writes "OT itself does not say much about
    the nature of constraints, beyond distinguishing between
    markedness and faithfulness. OT is a theory of how constraints
    interact with one another; it isn’t a theory of what the
    constraints are, nor is it a theory of representations." Why do
    you think this is or isn't true, and what does it meand for a
    theory of phonoligy?
