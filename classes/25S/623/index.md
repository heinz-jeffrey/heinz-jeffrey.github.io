# Course Log

## 27 Feb

* We discussed Vaux (2008) with a focus on issues related to opacity,
  optionality, and ineffability.
* Time permitting: [Polish Data](materials/PolishData.pdf)
* Assignment: [Hakha Lai](materials/HakhaLai.pdf) due March 11, 2025.

## 25 Feb

* We discussed Stratal Phonology (Bermudez-Otero 2018).
* For Thursday, read Vaux (2008), chapter 2 of [this
  book](materials/VauxNevins2008.pdf).

## 20 Feb

* We discussed [data](materials/cycle-lp.pdf) bearing on the notion of
  the cycle and lexical phonology.

* For Tuesday, please read sections 1 and 2 of [Bermudez-Otero
  2018](materials/Bermudez-Otero-2018.pdf), which was published in
  In S.J. Hannahs & Anna R. K. Bosch (eds.), 2018, The Routledge
  handbook of phonological theory, 100-134. Abingdon: Routledge.

## 18 Feb

* We discussed a couple more of McCathy's arguments against parallel
  OT in favor of HS (positional faithfulness and too many solutions).

## 13 Feb

* We discussed Harmonic Grammar vis a vis OT, and its probabilistic
  variants Noisy HG and MaxEnt HG, with a focus on typological
  predictions. See [Pater 2016](materials/Pater2016.pdf) for an
  overview and [Magri and Antilla's 2022
  MS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/68aaxicv7453n0u/ComputationalLinguisticsVersion2022.pdf?dl=0)
  for analysis of this topic.
* We also reviewed the architecture of Harmonic Serialism. See
  [McCarthy 2010](materials/McCarthy2010-HS.pdf) for an overview.

## 11 Feb

* We finished discussing Chapter 2 of McCarthy 2008,in particular
  richness of the base, lexical optimization, and recursive constraint
  demotion. We also discussed chapter 3.
* Reminder: Ilokano squib is due Feb 18, 2025 (1 week from today).


## 06 Feb

* We discussed some [excerpts](materials/Chapter2discussion.txt) from
  Chapter 2 of McCarthy 2008. We got through page 48.
* We sketched a rule-based analysis of Ilokano and discussed it vis a
  vis our descriptive generalizations and OT.
* For Tuesday, identify which other excerpts you would like to
  discsuss, and other items that are not on the excerpts from the
  later section.
* Also for Tuesday, read Chapter 3 of McCathy 2008.

## 04 Feb

* Today we discussed in more detail an OT analysis for the Ilokano
  assignment. We discussed harmonic bounding, how to make ranking
  arguments using entailed ranking conditions (W/L/e), how to
  interpret rows of W/L/e more generally, markedness hierarchies, and
  a couple different ways to handle optionality.
* Finish reading chapter 2 for Thursday.

## 30 Jan 2025

* We discussed the first three sections of Chapter 1 (McCarthy 2008).
* We began analyzing [some words in
  Ilokano](materials/Ilokano.pdf). This assignment (squib) is due
  February 13. Chapter 3 of McCarthy 2008 provides very helpful advice
  for how to write phonological analysis.
* For next Tuesday, finish reading Chapter 1 and read sections 1 and 2
  of chapter 2 (McCarthy 2008).

## 28 Jan 2025

* We went over the [syllabus](materials/LIN623_Syllabus_Spring2025.pdf).
* We discussed the [introduction](materials/01-intro.pdf) to this
  course. Please finish reading it before Thursday.
* For Thursday, please read sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 of [McCarthy 2008](materials/McCarthy2008-DOT.pdf)
  - Section 1.2 asks "Why Must Constraints Be Violable?" Is McCarthy's
    argument convincing? Why or why not?
  - In section 1.3, McCarthy writes "OT itself does not say much about
    the nature of constraints, beyond distinguishing between
    markedness and faithfulness. OT is a theory of how constraints
    interact with one another; it isnâ€™t a theory of what the
    constraints are, nor is it a theory of representations." Why do
    you think this is or isn't true, and what does it meand for a
    theory of phonoligy?
