NAME
       classify - determine subregular class membership

SYNOPSIS
       classify [-a|-A|-j|-p] [-e|-u] [-n|-N] [-hqv?] [-s symbols] class ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  classify  utility reads a finite-state automaton and determines whether it belongs to a provided set of complexity classes.
       The automaton is read from the standard input, and its format is determined by command-line options.  For the AT&T tabular  for‐
       mat, an optional symbol table may be provided with the -s option.

       The return value indicates whether any (-e, default) or all (-u) of the specified classes contain the pattern.

       Specifying  more  than one of any set of mutually-exclusive options shall not be considered an error.  The last option specified
       shall determine the behavior of the utility.

OPTIONS
   Formats
       -a     AT&T tabular format, input projection.  This is the default.

       -A     AT&T tabular format, output projection.

       -j     Jeff format.

       -p     PLEB format

   Reduction
       -e     Exit successfully iff any specified class contains the pattern.  This is the default.

       -u     Exit successfully iff all specified classes contain the pattern.

   Normalization
       -n     Normalize the pattern before processing.  This is the default.

       -N     Do not normalize the pattern before processing.  This is useful when dealing with an already-minimal finite-state  trans‐
              ducer rather than an acceptor.

   Other Options
       -h, -? Show a brief help message and exit.

       -q     Do not a output textual description of the membership queries.

       -v     Instead of doing any processing, print the version number and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       0      The pattern was contained as desired.

       >0     An error occurred, or the pattern was not contained as desired.
