<h2 id="apr">17 Apr</h2>
<ul>
<li>main lesson: Life is precious. Don’t sweat the small stuff.</li>
<li>We talked about the role of composition in the construction of morpho-phonological finite-systems.</li>
<li>We talked about the rol of composition in the construction of compilers of rewrite rules into finite-state transducers. (See <a href="materials/MohriSproat1996.pdf">Mohri and Sproat 1996</a> for details.)</li>
<li>Here are <a href="materials/minimize.md">instructions</a> on how to take a transducer in ATT format, prepare it for classification, and then classify it with plebby.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apr-1">15 Apr</h2>
<ul>
<li>We studied function composition with transducers.</li>
<li>We studied other closure operations of regular relations and functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apr-2">10 Apr</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We realized that the right FST in Figure 6 in Burness et al. 2021 is not the minimum FST. The minimum one is here: <a href="fig6rightmin.att">att</a>.</p>
<p><code>$ classify -N TDef TRDef &lt; fig6rightmin.att    [ ("TDef",True)    , ("TRDef",True)    ]</code></p></li>
<li><p>We discussed that unless we are sure that the DFT we have is minimal, we should do our best to minimize it.</p>
<ul>
<li>In pynini of pyfoma, we would want to read in an ATT file, minimize it, and then output a new ATT file which can be sent to <code>classify</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We discussed some of the differences between the FST libraries.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apr-3">08 Apr</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reviewed the Myhill relation and construction of the syntactic monoid from minimal DFTs.</li>
<li>We saw how to use the classify program in <a href="https://github.com/vvulpes0/Language-Toolkit-2">LTK</a> to classify transducers
<ul>
<li><a href="materials/classify-man.txt">classify man page</a></li>
<li>Example. Figure 6 in <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/5780/">Burness et al. 2021</a></li>
<li><a href="fig6right.att">att</a> <a href="materials/syms-fig6.txt">syms</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apr-4">03 Apr</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reviewed deterministic top-down tree transducers.</li>
<li>We discussed their expressivity re bottom-up ones.</li>
<li>We discussed Lambert and Heinz 2023, in particular:
<ul>
<li>What the Nerode and Myhill relations mean for string-to-string functions</li>
<li>What the minimal, deterministic, onward transducer is</li>
<li>How to obtain the syntactic monoid from that</li>
<li>And then algebraic analysis is the same as before!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t forget proposals are supposed to be approved by next Friday.</li>
<li>For next Tuesday, choose one process discussed in <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/5780/">Burness et al. 2019, sections 5 and 6</a>, or for a challenge, choose a FST used in NLP such as a <a href="https://github.com/cslu-nlp/DetectorMorse/blob/master/detectormorse/ptbtokenizer.py">tokenizer</a>, <a href="https://snowballstem.org/">stemmer</a>, or <a href="https://dmort27.github.io/subwordmodeling/assignments/project3.html">G2P, P2G</a>, something with <a href="https://github.com/dmort27/epitran">epitran</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apr-5">01 Apr</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reviewed 1-way, string-to-M transducers for an arbitrary monoid M.</li>
<li>We defined 1-way non-deterministic letter-to-letter transducers.</li>
<li>We defined 2-way transducers (see <a href="Dolatian-Heinz-2020-CCR2FT.pdf">Dolatian and Heinz 2020</a> for application to reduplication).</li>
<li>We identified five classes of interest: 1DFT ⊂ 1fNFT ⊂ 1NFT, 2DFT ⊂ 2NFT
<ul>
<li>1 means “1 way” and 2 mean “2 way”</li>
<li>D means “deterministic” and N means “non-deterministic”</li>
<li>f means “functional”</li>
<li>FT means “finite-state transducer”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compare with finite-state acceptors: 1DFA = 1NFA = 2DFA = 2NFA.</li>
<li>Note also 1DFTs come in two varieties (left and right).</li>
<li>We discussed (but little to no details provided) minimization and composition of FTs.</li>
<li>For Thursday, read <a href="materials/Lambert-Heinz-2023-ACISLF.pdf">Lambert and Heinz 2023</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mar">27 Mar</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reviewed deterministic bottom-up tree transducers.</li>
<li>We generalized deterministic string-to-string transducers to string-to-M transducers for an arbitrary monoid M.</li>
<li>We discussed the landscape of classes of finite-state string transducers.

<h2 id="mar-1">25 Mar</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today we began discussing finite-state transducers for both strings and trees. We went over the first parts of both chapter 6 and 7 in <a href="materials/TCL-FSA.pdf">these notes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mar-2">18-20 Mar</h2>
<ul>
<li>SPRING BREAK</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mar-3">13 Mar</h2>
<ul>
<li>We showed that culminativity is neither definite nor reverse definite.</li>
<li>We defined generalized definite and nilpotent (co/finite) languages and the equations that characterize them.</li>
<li>We were interrupted by a fire alarm.</li>
<li>We studied tier-based and multi-tier based extensions of classes of formal languages and algebraic characterizations of them.</li>
<li>We see multiple characterizations of culminativity (for instance both SP and TN).</li>
<li>During break:
<ul>
<li>Please read all of <a href="materials/Lambert-2025-Multier-Phonotactics.pdf">Lambert, forthcoming</a>.</li>
<li>Examine the associated <a href="materials/Lambert-2025-Multier-Phonotactics-extras.zip">plebby files</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mar-4">11 Mar</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reviewed the algebraic analysis of “stress penult without culminativity.”</li>
<li>We explained how the semigroup can also be represented with a Myhill Graph (which is a DFA whose states represent blocks in a partition which refines than the partition given by the Nerode relation.)</li>
<li>We reviewed the analysis from the HW “stress peninitial without culminativity.”</li>
<li>We reviewed reverse definite languages and the equations that characterize them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mar-5">06 Mar</h2>
<ul>
<li>We began discussing the algebraic approach to analysis of formal languages.
<ul>
<li>We explained how to obtain the elements of finite semigroup from a DFA by identifying the ‘actions’ each symbol, or sequence of symbols, induces on the DFA.</li>
<li>We explained how that semigroup can be represented with a concatentation table (Cayley table).</li>
<li>We defined k-definite languages using grammars, and showed how the elements of a semigroup for k-definite languages, and definite languages more generally satisfy particular equations.</li>
<li>Homework for Tuesday: determine the DFA, semigroup elements (actions), and the Cayley table for stress-peninitial without culminativity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mar-6">04 Mar</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reviewed a definition of Strictly k-Local tree languages in terms of “tiling” trees of depth k. We saw how the derivation tree language of any CFG is a SL-2 tree language.</li>
<li>We discussed Theorem 18 on page 56 of the course notes.</li>
<li>Switching gears, we began talking about the Myhill Equivalence relations, using section 6 of <a href="materials/Lambert-2025-Multier-Phonotactics.pdf">Lambert, forthcoming</a> as our guide.</li>
<li>For Thursday, please read section 6 up to section 6.2.1, but not including 6.2.1. (so bottom of page 24 to top of page 29)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feb">27 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reviewed deterministic, bottom-up and top-down finite state recognizers for tree languages.</li>
<li>We talked about the gorn addresses in a tree and definitions of trees as prefix-closed sets.</li>
<li>We defined rewrite grammars, and examined right-linear, left-linear and context-free grammars.</li>
<li>We examined the derivation trees of CFGs in light of recognizable tree languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feb-1">25 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>We defined deterministic, bottom-up tree acceptors and looked at some examples of how they work.</li>
<li>We defined deterministic, top-down tree acceptors and looked at some examples of how they work.</li>
<li>We discussed the expressivity of non-deterministic BU and TD acceptors with respect to the deterministic ones.</li>
<li>We discussed how they are recognizable tree languages are closed under intersection and union. They are not closed under complement with respect to Σᵀ, but they are closed under complement with respect to Σᵀⁿ, where n is the maximum branching factor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feb-2">20 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>We defined strings and trees as recursive data structures.</li>
<li>We showed how computations over trees such as length, size, and yield, have the same structure as their inputs.</li>
<li>We began defining bottom-up tree acceptors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feb-3">18 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>We discussed how to minimize DFA (identifying distinguishable states).</li>
<li>We introduced the Nerode equivalence relation.</li>
<li>We related the minimal DFA to this equivalence relation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feb-4">13 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>We reviewed some more of plebby’s features <a href="materials/pleb.txt">pleb.txt</a>.</li>
<li>We explained how to determinize NFA (powerset construction). For a proof, see pages 54-56 in <a href="materials/Sipser2013Chaps0-1.pdf">Chapter 1</a> of Sipser’s 2012 text. See <a href="materials/Kozen1997.pdf">Kozen1997</a> Chapter 6 for a more technically complete proof.</li>
<li>On Tuesday we will discuss how to minimize DFA (identifying distinguishable states) and we will relate this minimal DFA to the Nerode equivalence relation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feb-5">11 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>We sketched how to obtain a RE from a NFA. See pages 66-76 in <a href="materials/Sipser2013Chaps0-1.pdf">Chapter 1</a> of Sipser’s 2012 text.</li>
<li>We showed why NFA are closed under complement, intersection, and difference.</li>
<li>Using those facts, and the notion of reachable states, we showed we can decide whether one regular language is a subset of another. And then we can decide whether two regular languages are equal.</li>
<li>We played with plebby. <a href="materials/pleb.txt">pleb.txt</a></li>
<li>For Thursday, see if you can get the visualization (graphviz) installed. Also see if you can write PLEs for #12 and #13 in Example 1 in the course notes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feb-6">06 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>We looked at this <a href="materials/nfadfa-supplement.pdf">supplement</a>, which defines NFA and DFA and how they process strings from a non-recursive perspective. (This will change.)</li>
<li>We discussed how to visualize NFA and DFA as graphs.</li>
<li>We sketched how any RE can be expressed as a NFA because the base cases correspond to NFA and the inductive cases correspond to particular constructions.</li>
<li>We demonstrated plebby and its PLEs.</li>
<li>For Tuesday, please install plebby, and examine its tutorial, especially the section titled “Building a Linguistic Pattern”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feb-7">04 Feb</h2>
<ul>
<li>We defined and discussed CUEs, GREs, and SFEs and stated the facts (without proof) that
<ul>
<li>[[GREs]] = [[REs]] ⊃ [[SFEs]] ⊃ [[CUEs]] = FIN</li>
<li>even-a is a formal language expressible with REs but not SFEs</li>
<li>Regular languages and SFEs have other characterizations in terms of logic and algebra</li>
<li>This material is the subject of <a href="https://archive.org/details/CounterFre_00_McNa/">McNaughton and Papert 1971</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We also defined Dakotah’s Lambert’s Piecewise Local Expressions, which we will study further on Thursday.
<ul>
<li>The LTK software: <a href="https://github.com/vvulpes0/Language-Toolkit-2">Git</a> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-toolkit">Hackage</a></li>
<li><a href="materials/Lambert2024.pdf">Lambert 2024 paper about the software</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Theorem 6 in <a href="https://www.jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Heinz-RawalEtAl-2011-TSLCP.pdf">this paper</a> establishes that Tier-based Strictly Local languages are a subset of the Star-Free Languages. That they are a proper subset follows from Theorems 4 and 5.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jan-2025">30 Jan 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>We discussed concatenation, how to define formal grammars, and REs in Chapter 2.</li>
<li>For Tuesday, write a RE for the set containing all strings which do not contain the sequence aa (assume the alphabet is {a, b, c}).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jan-2025-1">28 Jan 2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>We went over the <a href="materials/LIN637_Syllabus_Spring2025.pdf">syllabus</a>.</li>
<li>We discussed Chapter 1 and began Chapter 2 of the <a href="materials/TCL-FSA.pdf">course’s lecture notes</a>.</li>
