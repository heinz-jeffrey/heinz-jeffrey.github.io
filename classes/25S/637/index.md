# Course Log


## 04 Feb

* We defined and discussed CUEs, GREs, and SFEs and stated the facts
  (without proof) that
  - [[GREs]] = [[REs]] ⊃ [[SFEs]] ⊃ [CUEs] = FIN
  - even-a is a formal language expressible with REs but not SFEs
  - Regular languages and SFEs have other characterizations in terms
    of logic and algebra
  - This material is the subject of [McNaughton and Papert
    1971](https://archive.org/details/CounterFre_00_McNa/)
* We also defined Dakotah's Lambert's Piecewise Local Expressions, which we will study further on Thursday.
  - The LTK software:
    [Git](https://github.com/vvulpes0/Language-Toolkit-2)
    [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-toolkit)
  - [Lambert 2024 paper about the software](materials/Lambert2024.pdf)
- Theorem 6 in [this
  paper](https://www.jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Heinz-RawalEtAl-2011-TSLCP.pdf)
  establishes that Tier-based Strictly Local languages are a subset of
  the Star-Free Languages. That they are a proper subset follows from
  Theorems 4 and 5.

## 30 Jan 2025

* We discussed concatenation, how to define formal grammars, and REs in Chapter 2.
* For Tuesday, write a RE for the set containing all strings which do
  not contain the sequence aa (assume the alphabet is {a, b, c}).

## 28 Jan 2025

* We went over the [syllabus](materials/LIN637_Syllabus_Spring2025.pdf).
* We discussed Chapter 1 and began Chapter 2 of the [course's lecture
  notes](materials/TCL-FSA.pdf).
